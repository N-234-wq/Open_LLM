18369456","Genomic research, publics and experts in Latin America: Nation, race and body.",2016-08-03,"The articles in this issue highlight contributions that studies of Latin America can make to wider debates about the effects of genomic science on public ideas about race and nation. We argue that current ideas about the power of genomics to transfigure and transform existing ways of thinking about human diversity are often overstated. If a range of social contexts are examined, the effects are uneven. Our data show that genomic knowledge can unsettle and reinforce ideas of nation and race; it can be both banal and highly politicized. In this introduction, we outline concepts of genetic knowledge in society; theories of genetics, nation and race; approaches to public understandings of science; and the Latin American contexts of transnational ideas of nation and race.",Genomics|Humans|Latin America|Racial Groups
27269264,Der Begriff der Verständlichkeit in der modernen Physik (1948).,2016-06-09,"This is a critical transcription of Paul Feyerabend's earliest extant essay ""Der Begriff der Verständlichkeit in der modernen Physik"" (1948) recovered from the European Forum Alpbach archives. In it, Feyerabend defends positivism as a progressive framework for scientific research in certain stages of scientific development. He argues that in physics visualizability (Anschaulichkeit) and intelligibility (Verständlichkeit) are time-conditioned concepts: what is deemed visualizable in the development of physical theories is relative to a specific historical context and changes over time. He concludes that from time to time the abandonment of visualizability is crucial for progress in physics, as it is conducive to major theory change, illustrating the point on the basis of advances in atomic theory.","History, 20th Century|Philosophy|Physics|Research"
27269258,Introduction: Reappraising Paul Feyerabend.,2016-06-09,"This volume is devoted to a reappraisal of the philosophy of Paul Feyerabend. It has four aims. The first is to reassess his already well-known work from the 1960s and 1970s in light of contemporary developments in the history and philosophy of science. The second is to explore themes in his neglected later work, including recently published and previously unavailable writings. The third is to assess the contributions that Feyerabend can make to contemporary debate, on topics such as perspectivism, realism, and political philosophy of science. The fourth and final aim is to reconsider Feyerabend's place within the history of philosophy of science in the light of new scholarship.","History, 20th Century|Philosophy|Science"
27136285,Tendinopathy: Evidence-Informed Physical Therapy Clinical Reasoning.,2016-05-03,"Patients presenting with pain at the tendon, which is associated with physical tasks and activities that specifically load that tendon, are at the center of this special issue. The current terminology for a symptomatic tendon presentation is tendinopathy, as this does not denote an underlying pathology, but rather signals that all is not well in the tendon. Tendinopathy is a prevalent and substantial problem, as it interferes with a person's capacity to lead a physically active and healthy life, which has a considerable flow-on effect on society in general. This issue deals with the contemporary physical therapy management of tendinopathy by providing a mix of evidence review and clinical expert opinion on commonly presenting tendinopathies of the lower and upper limbs.

27071207,Modern Approaches to Local Adaptation.,2016-04-14,"The study of local adaptation has been very important for the development of evolutionary biology broadly. This tradition continues; through new developments in diverse areas, we have more insight into the nature of the ongoing evolutionary process in a heterogeneous spatial context than ever before. This special issue follows from the 2014 Vice-Presidential Symposium of the American Society of Naturalists, bringing together outstanding researchers doing theoretical and empirical work, laboratory work, and fieldwork, with new data and new nodes of analysis. Through study of local adaptation, we learn about a tremendous source of biodiversity, both genetic and phenotypic, within and among species.","Adaptation, Physiological|Animals|Biodiversity|Biological Evolution|Phenotype|Selection, Genetic"

22057346",Biomarkers of (osteo)arthritis.,2016-03-10,"Arthritic diseases are a major cause of disability and morbidity, and cause an enormous burden for health and social care systems globally. Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis. The key risk factors for the development of OA are age, obesity, joint trauma or instability. Metabolic and endocrine diseases can also contribute to the pathogenesis of OA. There is accumulating evidence to suggest that OA is a whole-organ disease that is influenced by systemic mediators, inflammaging, innate immunity and the low-grade inflammation induced by metabolic syndrome. Although all joint tissues are implicated in disease progression in OA, articular cartilage has received the most attention in the context of aging, injury and disease. There is increasing emphasis on the early detection of OA as it has the capacity to target and treat the disease more effectively. Indeed it has been suggested that this is the era of ""personalized prevention"" for OA. However, the development of strategies for the prevention of OA require new and sensitive biomarker tools that can detect the disease in its molecular and pre-radiographic stage, before structural and functional alterations in cartilage integrity have occurred. There is also evidence to support a role for biomarkers in OA drug discovery, specifically the development of disease modifying osteoarthritis drugs. This Special Issue of Biomarkers is dedicated to recent progress in the field of OA biomarkers. The papers in this Special Issue review the current state-of-the-art and discuss the utility of OA biomarkers as diagnostic and prognostic tools.",Animals|Arthritis|Biomarkers|Early Diagnosis|Humans|Joints|Osteoarthritis|Predictive Value of Tests|Prognosis
26947274,Migration: Wall to Wall?,2016-03-08,"It is no news to anyone that health transcends national borders, driven by cross-border movement of vectors, populations, health professionals, climate, even policy trends. There is an increasing recognition that it is, in fact, a small world: we are affected by and affect what happens to our neighbors, whether they live around the corner or on the other side of the globe. This conception underpins the shift from the term international health to global health in policy discussions. The new terminology reflects change across several dimensions: from an approach in which there is one medicine for the developed world and another for developing countries, to an appreciation that we all have a stake in one another's wellbeing; from a primarily biomedical focus on treatment to a more multidisciplinary, population health focus taking into consideration a range of interventions to improve health and well-being, including the social and environmental determinants of health; and from a vertical bilateral-aid approach focused on specific diseases, to systems and ecological approaches addressing the complexities of health, involving multiple partnerships.",Cuba|Developing Countries|Emigration and Immigration|Global Health|Health Policy|Health Services Needs and Demand|Humans

24309475","Bridging evidence, policy, and practice to strengthen health systems for improved maternal and newborn health in Pakistan.",2016-01-23,"Policy and decision making should be based on evidence, but translating evidence into policy and practice is often sporadic and slow. It is recognised that the relationship between research and policy uptake is complex and that dissemination of research findings is necessary, but insufficient, for policy uptake. Political, social, and economic context, use of (credible) data and dialogues between and across networks of researchers and policymakers play important roles in evidence uptake. Advocacy is the process of mobilising political and public opinions to achieve specific aims and its role is crucial in mobilising key actors to push for policy uptake. Advocacy and research groups (i.e. those who would like to see research evidence used by policymakers) may use different approaches and tools to stimulate the diffusion of research findings. The use of mass- and social media, communication with study participants, and the involvement of stakeholders at the early stages of research development are examples of the approaches that can be employed to stimulate diffusion of evidence and increase evidence uptake. The Research and Advocacy Fund (RAF) for Maternal and Newborn Health (MNH) worked within the health system context in Pakistan with the aim of espousing the principles of evidence, advocacy, and dissemination to improve MNH outcomes. The articles included in this special issue are outputs of RAF and highlight where RAF's approaches contributed to MNH policy reforms. The papers discuss critical health system issues facing Pakistan, including service delivery components, demand creation, equitable access, transportation interventions for improved referrals, availability of medicines and equipment, and health workforce needs. In addition to these tangible elements, the health system 'software', i.e. the power and the political and social contexts, is also represented in the collection. These articles highlight three considerations for the future: the growing importance of implementation research, the crucial need for participation and ownership, and the recognition that policymaking can be 'informed' by rather than 'based-on' evidence. The future challenge will be to continue the momentum RAF has created and to welcome a new era of health, wealth, and growth for Pakistan.","Adult|Delivery of Health Care|Female|Government Programs|Health Policy|Humans|Infant Health|Infant, Newborn|Maternal Health|Maternal-Child Health Services|Pakistan|Pregnancy"

Hence, losses and declines of pollinating insect species threaten human food security and are of major concern not only for apiculture or agriculture but for human society in general. Honey bee colony losses and bumblebee declines have attracted intensive research interest over the last decade and although the problem is far from being solved we now know that viruses are among the key players of many of these bee losses and bumblebee declines. With this special issue on bee viruses we, therefore, aimed to collect high quality original papers reflecting the current state of bee virus research. To this end, we focused on newly discovered viruses (Lake Sinai viruses, bee macula-like virus), or a so far neglected virus species (Apis mellifera filamentous virus), and cutting edge technologies (mass spectrometry, RNAi approach) applied in the field.",Animals|Bees|Biomedical Research|Virology|Viruses

Electrical fields in cells are mainly due to the presence of channels which are permeable and selective for different ions and transporters. Modulation of their activities can affect cell cycle properties, proliferation and differentiation.Electrical fields are important for embryonic patterning, regeneration and tumour development. Membrane potential is a permanent signal which allows communication between cells, tissues and organs and has to be considered to have the same importance as biochemical signals. The activity of ion channels and pumps which maintain the electrical fields can now be dissected and visualized with new tools involving fluorescent reporters.Despite the fact that our understanding, at the molecular level, of the role of bioelectric signaling pathways, ion currents, voltage and pH gradients in developmental biology and tumor progression is increasing, therapeutic applications of this knowledge still appears to be far away.

""HeartWeek in Florida"", the joint collaborative project sponsored by the Cardiac Centre at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, together with Johns Hopkins All Children's Heart Institute of Saint Petersburg, Florida, averages over 1000 attendees every year and is now recognised as one of the major planks of continuing medical and nursing education for those working in the fields of diagnosis and treatment of cardiac disease in the foetus, neonate, infant, child, and adult. ""HeartWeek in Florida"" combines the International Symposium on Congenital Heart Disease, organised by All Children's Hospital and Johns Hopkins Medicine, and entering its 16th year, with the Annual Postgraduate Course in Paediatric Cardiovascular Disease, organised by The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia entering its 19th year. This December 2015 Issue of Cardiology in the Young features highlights of the two meetings that compose HeartWeek. Johns Hopkins All Children's Heart Institute's 15th Annual International Symposium on Congenital Heart Disease was held at the Renaissance Vinoy Resort & Golf Club, Saint Petersburg, Florida, from Friday, 6 February, 2015, to Monday, 9 February, 2015. This Symposium was co-sponsored by The American Association for Thoracic Surgery and its special focus was ""Congenital Abnormalities of the Coronary Arteries"". The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia's annual meeting - Cardiology 2015, the 18th Annual Update on Paediatric and Congenital Cardiovascular Disease: ""Challenges and Dilemmas"" - was held at the Hyatt Regency Scottsdale Resort and Spa at Gainey Ranch, Scottsdale, Arizona, from Wednesday, 11 February, 2015, to Sunday, 15 February, 2015.

Chronic RAAS activation in the presence of sufficient sodium consumption leads to persistent hypertension, setting off a cascade of inflammatory, thrombotic, and atherogenic effects eventually leading to end-organ damage 2 3. Accordingly, numerous studies have demonstrated that elevated renin and/or aldosterone levels are predictors of adverse outcome in hypertension 4, heart failure 5 6, myocardial infarction 7, and renal insufficiency 8 and influence insulin resistance 9. Primary aldosteronism (PA) is the most common secondary form of hypertension with an estimated prevalence between 4 and 12% of hypertensives 10 11 12 and 11-20% in patients that are resistant to combined antihypertensive medication 13 14. Given the severe cardiovascular adverse effects of aldosterone excess that are independent of high blood pressure levels 15 16 17 18 detection and treatment of PA has important impact on clinical outcome and survival.","Clinical Trials as Topic|Female|Humans|Hyperaldosteronism|Mutation|Translational Research, Biomedical"

24462490",Food Choice and Nutrition: A Social Psychological Perspective.,2015-12-17,"In this Special Issue, entitled ""Food choice and Nutrition: A Social Psychological Perspective"", three broad themes have been identified: (1) social and environmental influences on food choice; (2) psychological influences on eating behaviour; and (3) eating behaviour profiling.The studies that addressed the social and environmental influences indicated that further research would do well to promote positive food choices rather than reduce negative food choices; promote the reading and interpretation of food labels and find ways to effectively market healthy food choices through accessibility, availability and presentation. The studies on psychological influences found that intentions, perceived behavioural control, and confidence were predictors of healthy eating. Given the importance of psychological factors, such as perceived behavioural control and self-efficacy, healthy eating interventions should reduce barriers to healthy eating and foster perceptions of confidence to consume a healthy diet. The final theme focused on the clustering of individuals according to eating behaviour. Some ""types"" of individuals reported more frequent consumption of fast foods, ready meals or convenience meals or greater levels of disinhibitiona nd less control over food cravings. Intervention designs which make use of multi-level strategies as advocated by the Ecological Model of Behaviour change that proposes multi-level (combining psychological, social and environmental) strategies are likely to be more effective in reaching and engaging individuals susceptible to unhealthy eating habits than interventions operating on a single level.","Choice Behavior|Diet|Environment|Feeding Behavior|Food Preferences|Health Behavior|Health Promotion|Humans|Nutritional Status|Psychology, Social|Self-Control|Social Environment"

26292995","Unravelling how plants benefit from ROS and NO reactions, while resisting oxidative stress.",2015-12-10,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), such as nitric oxide (NO), play crucial roles in the signal transduction pathways that regulate plant growth, development and defence responses, providing a nexus of reduction/oxidation (redox) control that impacts on nearly every aspect of plant biology. Here we summarize current knowledge and concepts that lay the foundations of a new vision for ROS/RNS functions – particularly through signalling hubs – for the next decade.
Plants have mastered the art of redox control using ROS and RNS as secondary messengers to regulate a diverse range of protein functions through redox-based, post-translational modifications that act as regulators of molecular master-switches. Much current focus concerns the impact of this regulation on local and systemic signalling pathways, as well as understanding how such reactive molecules can be effectively used in the control of plant growth and stress responses.
The spectre of oxidative stress still overshadows much of our current philosophy and understanding of ROS and RNS functions. While many questions remain to be addressed – for example regarding inter-organellar regulation and communication, the control of hypoxia and how ROS/RNS signalling is used in plant cells, not only to trigger acclimation responses but also to create molecular memories of stress – it is clear that ROS and RNS function as vital signals of living cells.","Oxidation-Reduction|Oxidative Stress|Plants|Protein Processing, Post-Translational|Reactive Nitrogen Species|Reactive Oxygen Species|Signal Transduction"

26641411,Integrative Psychotherapy for Schizophrenia: Its Potential for a Central Role in Recovery Oriented Treatment.,2015-12-08,"Research has affirmed that recovery from serious mental illnesses (SMI), such as schizophrenia, is a common outcome and often involves subjective changes in the experience of self, one's identity, and one's sense of agency in the world. Although many different interventions have been developed and validated, efforts to consider how those interventions should be integrated to assist people to direct their own recovery have been limited. This article considers the 5 case reports of psychotherapy presented in this special issue that have sought to integrate scientifically valid approaches within a recovery frame work. Exploring shared themes, this article suggests that a common set of processes exists between these examples of integrative work. These include therapist acceptance of a vulnerable stance in the face of uncertainty, which rejects stigma and remains open to knowing the person. This ultimately allows the kinds of meaning to be made jointly between the therapist and client that promote recovery.","Humans|Outcome and Process Assessment, Health Care|Psychotherapy|Schizophrenia"

What care looks and feels like is both context-specific and perspective-dependent. Yet, this elusiveness does not mean that it lacks importance. In our engagements with the worlds that we study, construct, and inhabit, we cannot but care: care is an essential part of being a researcher and a citizen.

The specificities of these partner proteins (lectins) for their glycan ligands are determined by factors such as glycan composition, shape and density of expression and the involvement of the aglycone moiety as part of the recognition motif. There is increasing knowledge on the mechanisms of these interactions as new secondary binding sites continue to be elucidated adding to the functional awareness of sugar-binding proteins. This issue focuses on recent advances in understanding how C-type lectins in the immune system work, how novel motifs involving asymmetric glycan branch recognition and protein-protein interactions influence critical biological functions including signal transduction and bactericidal pore formation, recent studies on novel glycan-binding proteins produced by bacteriophage, analysis of the interactions between heparin/heparan sulphate and their binding proteins, and recent findings on the molecular interactions between chondroitin-dermatan sulphate and various bioactive protein components.

As part of a larger study, families with IHH were screened for mutations in genes known to be associated with IHH. In family 1, a 15-year and 9-month-old boy first presented during infancy with micropenis and bilateral cryptorchidism. His pubic and axillary hair is at stage 4 and 2, respectively. His testes are 1 ml bilaterally, and his stretched penile length is 3.6 cm. In family 2, a 19-year and 2-month-old man was referred because of absence of secondary sexual characteristics. His 13-year and 8-month-old sister did not have any breast development.
In 3 patients from 2 independent families we identified GNRH1 mutations. In the proband from family 1, a homozygous 1-base deletion (c.87delA) leading to a frameshift mutation (p.G29GfsX12) was identified. In family 2, the affected siblings had a novel homozygous mutation of c.G92A leading to p.R31H.
Both mutations in these families are located in the region encoding the decapeptide and in the loci where the mutations have been described before. Therefore, these areas can be considered as mutational hot spots, indicating priority for routine diagnostic gene mutation analysis.",Adolescent|Cohort Studies|DNA Mutational Analysis|Female|Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone|Homozygote|Humans|Hypogonadism|Male|Protein Precursors|Young Adult

26535443,Adaptive and innate immune modulators of inflammation and autoimmunity.,2015-11-05,"Both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The association of specific major histocompatibility complex (MHC) alleles with susceptibility to particular autoimmune diseases is well known, although the mechanistic aspects of this link are not fully unraveled yet. Furthermore, the prevalence of many autoimmune diseases is much higher in females than in males. Intensive efforts are currently being directed to defining the role of sex hormones, the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, and other modifying factors in this sexual dimorphism. Among the environmental factors, emerging understanding of the interplay between the gut microbiota and the immune system has opened up a new frontier of biomedical research with a renewed perspective of host-environment interactions. In addition, besides specific T helper subsets and their cytokine products, the roles of the scavenger receptors, the inflammasome, the newer cytokines of the IL-1 (e.g., IL-33, IL-37) and IL-12 (e.g., IL-27, IL-35) families, and the soluble mediators produced by adipocytes (adipokines) (e.g., leptin, adiponectin) in the pathogenesis of inflammation, autoimmunity, and metabolic disorders are increasingly being realized. In this special issue, ""Cytokines in Immune Pathology and Therapy,"" second volume, leading experts have shared their research work and perspectives on the above-mentioned cytokines and other modulators of inflammation and autoimmunity.

17603655",Introduction: Communicating Reproduction.,2015-11-03,"Communication should be central to histories of reproduction, because it has structured how people do and do not reproduce. Yet communication has been so pervasive, and so various, that it is often taken for granted and the historical specificities overlooked. Making communication a frame for histories of reproduction can draw a fragmented field together, including by putting the promotion of esoteric ideas on a par with other practical activities. Paying communication close attention can revitalize the history of reproduction over the long term by highlighting continuities as well as the complex connections between new technologies and new approaches. Themes such as the power of storytelling, the claiming and challenging of expertise, and relations between knowledge and ignorance, secrecy and propriety also invite further study.","Communication|Europe|History, 15th Century|History, 16th Century|History, 17th Century|History, 18th Century|History, 19th Century|History, 20th Century|History, 21st Century|Humans|Knowledge|North America|Reproduction"
26520390,Editorial.,2015-11-02,"Cancer is a multifaceted disease and research over decades has sequentially broadened our understanding of the mechanisms which underlie its development, progression and resistance against wide ranging molecular therapeutics. Data obtained through in-vitro studies and xenografted mice based investigations clearly suggested that inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, overexpression of oncogenes, imbalance of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins, loss of apoptosis, dysregulation of spatio-temporally controlled intracellular signaling cascades, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, intra-tumor heterogeneity are significantly involved in regulation of different steps of cancer. Recently emerging information is also shedding light on considerable role of microRNAs in cancer and we have seen an exponential growth in the list of tumor suppressor and oncogenic miRNAs. Amirkhah et al, described how miRNAs regulated resistance mechanisms against different therapeutics in colorectal cancer. Nosheen Masood and Muhammad Zahid Qureshi emphasized on intricate interplay between Notch signaling and different miRNAs in head and neck cancer. Gasparri et al discussed new frontiers in therapeutic targets in ovarian cancer with spotlight on PARP inhibitors. Notch mediated intracellular signaling in esophageal cancer was comprehensively explained by Wang et al. Resistance mechanisms against TRAIL based therapeutics were described in detail by Limami et al. The authors gave opinion about different approaches which have been tested in preclinical trials to overcome resistance against TRAIL. Mansoor et al reported that GG genotype in death receptor 4 played protective role however, CC genotype had a causative role in colorectal cancer in Pakistani population. Larger pool of patients, sporadic mutations, expression studies will further demystify the association. Hsu et al, extensively described various strategies focusing on how post-translationally modifiable histones can be targeted for cancer treatment. Attar et al provided detailed information related to Viscum album against different cancers. Ahmadi et al studied network structure information and biological data on miRNA-and transcription factor-based gene regulation. Apoptotic cell death is a key mechanism frequently inactivated in cancer cells and different strategies have been used to re-activate/functionalize apoptotic pathway in drug resistant phenotype. We have attempted to present most recent landmarks set in cancer biology and therapeutics. Sarkar et al review summarized multifunctional roles of ASPP (apoptosis stimulating proteins of p53) family in cancer. Smina et al reported that Hesperetin, a flavonoid effectively induced apoptosis in skin cancer cell line. Chong et al experimentally verified that lipid accumulation may not only induce pro-inflammatory responses in hepatocytes but also activate CSC-like properties of hepatoma cells through NFκB activation. The present thematic issue brings to limelight most recent advancements in constantly developing field of molecular oncology.","Animals|Apoptosis|Genes, Tumor Suppressor|Humans|MicroRNAs|Neoplasms"
26515381,Introduction: Microbiome in human reproduction.,2015-10-31,"The human microbiome has been termed the ""second human genome"" and data that has come about of late certainly makes it appear every bit as complex. The human body contains 10-fold more microbial cells than the human cells and accounts for 1%-3% of our total body mass. As we learn more about this symbiotic relationship, it appears this complex interaction occurs in nearly every part of the body, even those areas at one time considered to be sterile. Indeed, the microbiome in human reproduction has been investigated in terms of both the lower and upper reproductive tract and includes interactions even at the point of gametogenesis. What is all the more fascinating is that we have known about the importance of microbes for over 150 years, even before they existed in name. And now, with the assistance of an exciting technologic revolution which has pushed forward our understanding of the microbiome, we appear to stand on the precipice of a higher level of understanding of microbes, the biofilms they create, and their impact of health and disease in human reproduction.","Bacteria|Biofilms|Dysbiosis|Female|Fertility|Genitalia|Host-Pathogen Interactions|Humans|Infertility|Male|Microbiota|Reproduction|Reproductive Techniques, Assisted"

To comprehensively assess the effects of the use of biodiesel as an energy source, end stage uses of biodiesel such as the effects of inhalation of combusted products on human health must be incorporated. To date, few reports concerning the toxicological effects of the emissions of combusted biodiesel or blends of biodiesel on surrogates of health effects have been published. The relative toxicity of the combusted biodiesel emissions compared to petroleum diesel emissions with short term exposures is also not well known. To address the paucity of findings on the toxicity of combusted biodiesel emissions, studies were undertaken at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency laboratories in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. The studies used a variety of approaches with nonhuman animal models to examine biological responses of the lung and cardiovascular systems induced by acute and repeated exposures to pure biodiesel and biodiesel blended with petroleum diesel. Effects of the emissions on induction of mutations in bacterial test strains and mammalian DNA adducts were also characterized and normalized to engine work load. The emissions were characterized as to the physicochemical composition in order to determine the magnitude of the differences among the emissions utilized in the studies. This article summarizes the major finding of these studies which are contained within this special issue of Inhalation Toxicology. The findings provided in these articles provide information about the toxicity of biodiesel emissions relative to petroleum diesel emissions and which can be utilized in a life cycle analyses of the effects of increased biodiesel usage.",Animals|Biofuels|Humans|Mutagens|North Carolina|Petroleum|Glycine max|United States|United States Environmental Protection Agency|Vehicle Emissions

26363799",Repetitive DNA in eukaryotic genomes.,2015-10-31,"Repetitive DNA--sequence motifs repeated hundreds or thousands of times in the genome--makes up the major proportion of all the nuclear DNA in most eukaryotic genomes. However, the significance of repetitive DNA in the genome is not completely understood, and it has been considered to have both structural and functional roles, or perhaps even no essential role. High-throughput DNA sequencing reveals huge numbers of repetitive sequences. Most bioinformatic studies focus on low-copy DNA including genes, and hence, the analyses collapse repeats in assemblies presenting only one or a few copies, often masking out and ignoring them in both DNA and RNA read data. Chromosomal studies are proving vital to examine the distribution and evolution of sequences because of the challenges of analysis of sequence data. Many questions are open about the origin, evolutionary mode and functions that repetitive sequences might have in the genome. Some, the satellite DNAs, are present in long arrays of similar motifs at a small number of sites, while others, particularly the transposable elements (DNA transposons and retrotranposons), are dispersed over regions of the genome; in both cases, sequence motifs may be located at relatively specific chromosome domains such as centromeres or subtelomeric regions. Here, we overview a range of works involving detailed characterization of the nature of all types of repetitive sequences, in particular their organization, abundance, chromosome localization, variation in sequence within and between chromosomes, and, importantly, the investigation of their transcription or expression activity. Comparison of the nature and locations of sequences between more, and less, related species is providing extensive information about their evolution and amplification. Some repetitive sequences are extremely well conserved between species, while others are among the most variable, defining differences between even closely relative species. These data suggest contrasting modes of evolution of repetitive DNA of different types, including selfish sequences that propagate themselves and may even be transferred horizontally between species rather than by descent, through to sequences that have a tendency to amplification because of their sequence motifs, to those that have structural significance because of their bulk rather than precise sequence. Functional consequences of repeats include generation of variability by movement and insertion in the genome (giving useful genetic markers), the definition of centromeres, expression under stress conditions and regulation of gene expression via RNA moieties. Molecular cytogenetics and bioinformatic studies in a comparative context are now enabling understanding of the nature and behaviour of this major genomic component.","DNA|Eukaryota|Genome|Genomics|Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid"

25793642",Percussive technology in human evolution: an introduction to a comparative approach in fossil and living primates.,2015-10-21,"Percussive technology is part of the behavioural suite of several fossil and living primates. Stone Age ancestors used lithic artefacts in pounding activities, which could have been most important in the earliest stages of stone working. This has relevant evolutionary implications, as other primates such as chimpanzees and some monkeys use stone hammer-and-anvil combinations to crack hard-shelled foodstuffs. Parallels between primate percussive technologies and early archaeological sites need to be further explored in order to assess the emergence of technological behaviour in our evolutionary line, and firmly establish bridges between Primatology and Archaeology. What are the anatomical, cognitive and ecological constraints of percussive technology? How common are percussive activities in the Stone Age and among living primates? What is their functional significance? How similar are archaeological percussive tools and those made by non-human primates? This issue of Phil. Trans. addresses some of these questions by presenting case studies with a wide chronological, geographical and disciplinary coverage. The studies presented here cover studies of Brazilian capuchins, captive chimpanzees and chimpanzees in the wild, research on the use of percussive technology among modern humans and recent hunter-gatherers in Australia, the Near East and Europe, and archaeological examples of this behaviour from a million years ago to the Holocene. In summary, the breadth and depth of research compiled here should make this issue of Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B, a landmark step forward towards a better understanding of percussive technology, a unique behaviour shared by some modern and fossil primates.",Animals|Archaeology|Biological Evolution|Fossils|Humans|Primates|Technology|Tool Use Behavior

26475446,Introduction.,2015-10-18,"The Japanese Society for Vaccinology (JSV) is an academic organization with approximately 1000 members, who work to combat infectious disease outbreak, to develop vaccines, to look into the basic fundamentals of vaccinology, immunology, and infectious diseases, to clarify the epidemiology, and to produce vaccines. JSV has been established in 1997. Although JSV is still young scientific community in the field of a broad-range vaccinology in Japan, we believe that Japanese scientists in the field of vaccinology have contributed to combating or managing the infectious diseases and promotion of the basic research in vaccinology. Prof. M. Takahashi developed a highly attenuated varicella vaccine in the 1970s. Prof. S. Hashizume developed a highly attenuated smallpox vaccine. The development of these vaccines has contributed not only to reduce the burden of infectious diseases in our society, but also to developing the new vaccines for other infectious diseases in the future. The development of varicella vaccine by Prof. M. Takahashi is one of the great achievements in the vaccinology. We, the JSV members, believe that we need to keep and strengthen the academic activity in the field of vaccinology as we have done before. In this supplement, Special Issue from the Japanese Society for Vaccinology, the manuscripts submitted by the members of JSV, which are partly specific to Japan but contribute to the international society, are published. The contents of the manuscripts are focused on development of new vaccines, epidemiology of vaccine preventable diseases, evaluation of currently used vaccines, and basic vaccinology in Japan.","Communicable Disease Control|History, 20th Century|Humans|Japan|Societies, Scientific|Vaccines"

History of reptile placentology: Studiati's early account of placentation in a viviparous lizard.,2015-10-18,"Although placental diversity in mammals received growing attention in the 1600s through the early 1800s, placentation was not documented in reptiles until the mid-19th century. In his classic 1855 study on a viviparous lizard, Cesare Studiati (University of Pisa) described a structural/functional arrangement of fetal and maternal tissues that meets contemporary criteria for recognition of placentation. Through the fortuitous selection of a highly placentotrophic species, Chalcides chalcides, Studiati recognized the functional role of placental tissues in provision of oxygen as well as nutrients. Although Studiati worked in a pre-evolutionary milieu and without the benefits of histological techniques, his findings revealed that viviparous reptiles could exhibit placental specializations that paralleled those of mammals. Accordingly, his classic paper initiated a highly productive body of research that has continued to the present and highlighted specializations of a species that has figured importantly in placental research.","Animals|Female|History, 19th Century|Lizards|Physiology, Comparative|Placentation|Pregnancy|Viviparity, Nonmammalian"

Legally protecting some of these areas through the creation of protected areas is a key component of conservation efforts globally. To develop effective protected area networks, practitioners need credible, scientific evidence about the degree to which protected areas affect environmental and social outcomes, and how these effects vary with context. Such evidence has been lacking, but the situation is changing as conservation scientists adopt more sophisticated research designs for evaluating protected areas' past impacts and for predicting their future impacts. Complementing these scientific advances, conservation funders and practitioners are paying increasing attention to evaluating their investments with more scientifically rigorous evaluation designs.

26455508,Notes towards a 'social aesthetic': Guest editors' introduction to the special section.,2015-10-13,"There is an emerging 'aesthetic turn' within sociology which currently lacks clear focus. This paper reviews the different issues feeding into this interest and contributes to its development. Previous renderings of this relationship have set the aesthetic up against sociology, as an emphasis which 'troubles' conventional understandings of sociality and offers no ready way of reconciling the aesthetic with the social. Reflecting on the contributions of recent social theorists, from figures including Bourdieu, Born, Rancière, Deleuze, and Martin, we argue instead for the value of a social aesthetic which critiques instrumentalist and reductive understandings of the social itself. In explicating what form this might take, the latter parts of the paper take issue with classical modernist conceptions of the aesthetic which continue to dominate popular and sociological understandings of the aesthetic, and uses the motif of 'walking' to show how the aesthetic can be rendered in terms of 'the mundane search' and how this search spans everyday experience and cultural re-production. We offer a provisional definition of social aesthetics as the embedded and embodied process of meaning making which, by acknowledging the physical/corporeal boundaries and qualities of the inhabited world, also allows imagination to travel across other spaces and times. It is hoped that this approach can be a useful platform for further inquiry.",Editorial Policies|Esthetics|Humans|Periodicals as Topic|Social Theory|Sociology

The meeting also provides a venue for a global research community to share ideas and to initiate collaborations. All plenary and contributed abstracts are being published as an open-access special issue of Genome. Here, I use a comparison with the 3rd Conference (Mexico City, 2009) to highlight 10 recent and emerging trends that are apparent among the contributed abstracts. One of the outstanding trends is the rising proportion of abstracts that focus upon multiple socio-economically important applications of DNA barcoding, including studies of agricultural pests, quarantine and invasive species, wildlife forensics, disease vectors, biomonitoring of ecosystem health, and marketplace surveys evaluating the authenticity of seafood products and medicinal plants. Other key movements include the use of barcoding and metabarcoding approaches for dietary analyses-and for studies of food webs spanning three or more trophic levels-as well as the spread of next-generation sequencing methods in multiple contexts. In combination with the rising taxonomic and geographic scope of many barcoding iniatives, these developments suggest that several important questions in biology are becoming tractable. ""What is this specimen on an agricultural shipment?"", ""Who eats whom in this whole food web?"", and even ""How many species are there?"" are questions that may be answered in time periods ranging from a few years to one or a few decades. The next phases of DNA barcoding may expand yet further into prediction of community shifts with climate change and improved management of biological resources.","Animals|Biodiversity|DNA Barcoding, Taxonomic|Ecological Parameter Monitoring|Humans"

Mentalizing, which provides the central construct around which mentalization-based therapy (MBT) and theory is organized, refers to the capacity to meaningfully reflect on the mind of others as well as the self. In this introductory article to the special issue, we begin by discussing the need for and nature of translational research. We contend that translational research in mental health and personality disorder, in particular, lags behind that of other medical disorders because of the challenges inherent in meeting translational criteria. We discuss these criteria and we demonstrate the potential of the construct of mentalizing to meet translational criteria in the context of BPD. This article thereby provides the context for the other 3 papers in this special issue which each represent a different point along the translational spectrum.

The editors solicited contributions from many leading figures in a broad array of scientific and philosophical disciplines, with emphasis on phenomenological approaches to philosophy (see Section I). The motivating force was the conviction that if we could find a viable bridge for the gap between the ""two cultures""(1) of science and philosophy, fundamental problems in each camp could be addressed more fruitfully than ever before and a new kind of science be born. We believe the unprecedented cross-fertilization of ideas from this initiative may furnish seeds from which that new, better integrated, and more effective approach to science may arise. This Special Issue consists of forty papers. For each one, multiple reviewers were solicited, with at least one reviewer from each ""culture"" (a scientist and a philosopher). In many cases, several rounds of revision were carried out. Needless to say, this required great patience and dedication of all participants. The editors gratefully acknowledge the contributions of our authors, and of our anonymous reviewers, who worked long and hard on the papers we sent them with no compensation for their efforts. We also wish to thank the Elsevier editorial and production team for the support they gave us in bringing this project to fruition. We would now like to offer a synoptic overview of the Special Issue, proceeding section by section and paper by paper. Our hope is that the reader will find this unique effort to marry science and philosophy both meaningful and enjoyable.",Biology|Mathematics|Natural Science Disciplines|Philosophy|Physics
26413943,An Introduction to Thinking about Trustworthy Research into the Genetics of Intelligence.,2015-09-29,"The advent of new technologies has rekindled some hopes that it will be possible to identify genetic variants that will help to explain why individuals are different with respect to complex traits. At least one leader in the development of ""whole genome sequencing""-the Chinese company BGI-has been quite public about its commitment to using the technique to investigate the genetics of intelligence in general and high intelligence in particular. Because one needs large samples to detect the small effects associated with small genetic differences in the sequence of those base pairs, to make headway with the new sequencing technologies, one also needs to enlist much larger numbers of study participants than geneticists have enrolled before. In an effort to increase the size of a sample, one team of researchers approached the Center for Talented Youth at Johns Hopkins University. They wanted to gain access to records concerning participants in CTY's ongoing Study of Exceptional Talent, and they wanted to approach those individuals to see if they would be willing to share samples of their DNA. We agreed that CTY's dilemma about whether to give the researchers access to those records raised larger questions about the ethics of research into the genetics of intelligence, and we decided to hold a workshop at The Hastings Center that could examine those questions. Our purpose was to create what, borrowing from Sarah Richardson, we came to call a ""transformative conversation"" about research into the genetics of general cognitive ability-a conversation that would take a wide and long view and would involve a diverse group of stakeholders, including both people who have been highly critical of the research and people who engage in it. This collection of essays, which grew out of that workshop, is intended to provide an introduction to and exploration of this complex and important area.","Adolescent|Cognition|Educational Status|Ethics, Research|Genetic Privacy|Genetic Research|Genetic Variation|Humans|Intelligence|Records|Sequence Analysis, DNA|Trust"

This introduction to a special issue of Disasters on the history of humanitarian action explores this question and outlines how the other submissions to the edition, each with its own approach and focus area from the nineteenth-century to the present today, make different contributions to understanding of humanitarian action. The paper argues that the value of history lies not so much in the information it might offer, but in the challenges it can pose to habitual ways of thinking and in the skills of investigation and interpretation it fosters. These attributes make historical perspectives a potentially valuable addition to the critical questioning of humanitarian practitioners and policymakers. The paper advocates integrating history into a more reflective attitude to change and a more adventurous and holistic approach to innovation, as opposed to simply using it to 'learn lessons'.","Altruism|Archives|History, 19th Century|History, 20th Century|History, 21st Century|Humans|Relief Work"
26381937,Introduction: Applying Chemical Biology to Ion Channels.,2015-09-19,"Ion channels are membrane-spanning proteins that control the flow of ions across biological membranes through an aqueous pathway. The opening or closing of this pore can be controlled by a myriad of physiological inputs (voltage, ligands, temperature, metabolites, pH), which in turn allow for the controlled flux of ions across membranes, resulting in the generation of minute electrical signals. The functional implications of ion channel function on physiological processes are vast. Electrical impulses, in the form of action potentials or diverse chemo-electrical signals, coordinate the syncytium of the heart beat, support a myriad of neuronal communication pathways, insulin secretion, and are central to the immune response, with more roles being discovered virtually everyday. Thus, ion channel function is a biophysical process that is central to biological life at many levels. And with over 500 channel-forming subunits known today in humans, this large class of proteins is also increasingly recognised as important drug targets, as inherited or acquired ion channel dysfunction are known causes of disease.","Animals|Humans|Ion Channel Gating|Ion Channels|Ion Transport|Protein Processing, Post-Translational|Signal Transduction"
26378375,Introduction: Reflections of Senior Therapists.,2015-09-18,"This introduction to this issue of JCLP: In Session (""Reflections of Senior Therapists"") focuses on the multifaceted ways in which adult development influences what it means to be a psychotherapist and to do the work of psychotherapy. This issue brings together first person narratives written by a group of eminent psychotherapists as well as an empirical report, based on a major international survey, on the challenges, demands, and rewards experienced by senior therapists. Taken together, these essays provide a compelling case that not only can practicing psychotherapy during the later years of one's life continue to be fulfilling and meaningful, but also the lessons learned along the journey can make one an even wiser and more effective therapist than previously. Learning to do psychotherapy, like adult development itself, is not a process that at some point comes to an end, but one that is resumed again and again in every decade. These essays provide a rich array of information, insight, and guidance regarding the personal and professional experience of practicing therapy during every era of adulthood, including one's senior years.",Aged|Aging|Health Personnel|Humans|Personal Narratives as Topic|Psychotherapy

The science and art of caring for these patients continues to evolve. The International Pediatric Heart Failure Summit of Johns Hopkins All Children's Heart Institute was held on 4 and 5 February, 2015. The 2015 International Pediatric Heart Failure Summit of Johns Hopkins All Children's Heart Institute was funded through the Andrews/Daicoff Cardiovascular Program Endowment, a philanthropic collaboration between All Children's Hospital and the Morsani College of Medicine at the University of South Florida (USF). Sponsored by All Children's Hospital Andrews/Daicoff Cardiovascular Program, the Johns Hopkins All Children's Heart Institute International Pediatric Heart Failure Summit assembled leaders in clinical and scientific disciplines related to paediatric heart failure and created a multi-disciplinary ""think-tank"".

This article serves as an introduction to the special issue on ""Patient-focused and feedback research in psychotherapy: Where are we and where do we want to go?"" Current investigations on feedback research are concerned with potential moderators and mediators of these effects, as well as the design and the implementation of feedback into routine care. This introduction summarizes the current state of feedback research and provides an overview of the three main research topics in this issue: (1) How to implement feedback systems into routine practice and how do therapist and patient attitudes influence its effects?, (2) How to design feedback reports and decision support tools?, and (3) What are the reasons for patients to become at risk of treatment failure and how should therapists intervene with these patients? We believe that the studies included in this special issue reflect the current state of feedback research and provide promising pathways for future endeavors that will enhance our understanding of feedback effects.","Biomedical Research|Feedback|Humans|Outcome Assessment, Health Care|Patient-Centered Care|Psychotherapy"

Although dissemination research is limited in most disciplines, it is particularly lacking in the social science field. Many interventions aimed to help children and adolescents are found to be efficacious every year, but program developers are often not equipped to understand how to scale up a program or sustain it after the initial funding. Consumers (e.g., service providers, who are consumers of interventions), on the other hand, often do not understand all that goes into implementing and scaling up an intervention. This special issue will: (a) introduce readers to the problem; (b) discuss some of the challenges with disseminating programs; and (c) present various existing supports that can help scale up and sustain interventions.",Adolescent|Adolescent Health Services|Diffusion of Innovation|Evidence-Based Practice|Government Programs|Humans|Program Development
26375152,Feminism and/in/as psychology: The public sciences of sex and gender.,2015-09-17,"In our introduction to this special issue on the histories of feminism, gender, sexuality, and the psy-disciplines, we propose the tripartite framework of ""feminism and/in/as psychology"" to conceptualize the dynamics of their conjoined trajectories and relationship to gender and sexuality from the late 19th through the late 20th centuries. ""Feminism and psychology"" highlights the tensions between a political movement and a scientific discipline and the efforts of participants in each to problematize the other. ""Feminism in psychology"" refers to those historical moments when self-identified feminists intervened in psychology to alter its content, methodologies, and populations. We propose, as have others, that these interventions predate the 1970s, the period most commonly associated with the ""founding"" of feminist psychology. Finally, ""feminism as psychology/psychology as feminism"" explores the shared ground between psychology and feminism-the conceptual, methodological, and (more rarely) epistemological moments when psychology and feminism made common cause. We suggest that the traffic between feminism and psychology has been persistent, continuous, and productive, despite taking different historically and geographically contingent forms.","Female|Feminism|Gender Identity|History, 19th Century|History, 20th Century|Humans|Politics|Psychology|Science|Sexuality"

23185138",Exploring the ethical and regulatory issues in pragmatic clinical trials.,2015-09-17,"The need for high-quality evidence to support decision making about health and health care by patients, physicians, care providers, and policy-makers is well documented. However, serious shortcomings in evidence persist. Pragmatic clinical trials that use novel techniques including emerging information and communication technologies to explore important research questions rapidly and at a fraction of the cost incurred by more ""traditional"" research methods promise to help close this gap. Nevertheless, while pragmatic clinical trials can bridge clinical practice and research, they may also raise difficult ethical and regulatory challenges. In this article, the authors briefly survey the current state of evidence that is available to inform clinical care and other health-related decisions and discuss the potential for pragmatic clinical trials to improve this state of affairs. They then propose a new working definition for pragmatic research that centers upon fitness for informing decisions about health and health care. Finally, they introduce a project, jointly undertaken by the National Institutes of Health Health Care Systems Research Collaboratory and the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet), which addresses 11 key aspects of current systems for regulatory and ethical oversight of clinical research that pose challenges to conducting pragmatic clinical trials. In the series of articles commissioned on this topic published in this issue of Clinical Trials, each of these aspects is addressed in a dedicated article, with a special focus on the interplay between ethical and regulatory considerations and pragmatic clinical research aimed at informing ""real-world"" choices about health and health care.",Biomedical Research|Clinical Trials as Topic|Decision Making|Humans|National Institutes of Health (U.S.)|Research Design|Surveys and Questionnaires|United States

26363383,Introduction: Management of endometriosis: moving toward a problem-oriented and patient-centered approach.,2015-09-13,"Endometriosis is a protean disease, and its manifestations, associated clinical problems, and possible treatments are numerous. Deep endometriosis that infiltrates multiple pelvic organs should be considered the most severe endometriotic form that poses the most difficult therapeutic uncertainties in both infertility and pelvic pain symptoms limiting quality of life. The available evidence demonstrates that endometriosis is not only a gynecologic disorder but, contrary to previous belief, its impact extends into pregnancy, delivery, and the post-partum period. The old clinical tenet that pregnancy is a cure for endometriosis may be revealed as fallacious. Safe and effective modalities to reduce the risk of the recurrence of symptoms and lesions after conservative surgery for endometriosis are now available. These treatment options should be offered post-operatively to women not immediately seeking conception. Endometriosis is associated with a moderate increase in ovarian cancer risk. However, as there are no definitive demonstrations that endometriosis constitutes per se a pre-neoplastic condition, it seems currently unwise to set-up a screening program to detect undiagnosed endometriosis in asymptomatic women. Endometriosis is not a cancer; therefore a paradigm shift from treatment of lesions to treatment of symptoms is warranted. Management should be shaped on the main clinical problem, taking into consideration a woman's preferences and priorities. Quantitative information should be provided to describe the potential benefits, potential harms, and costs of each treatment alternative. Counseling should be complete and transparent, and the duty of the caring gynecologist is to inform the woman on the pros and cons of each option and support her in the shared decision-making process. The physician should be able to explain in detail all the available treatments, and not only those that the physician prefers or is able to offer.","Endometriosis|Female|Humans|Infertility, Female|Ovarian Neoplasms|Patient-Centered Care|Pelvic Pain|Pregnancy"

The term ""monogamy"" has undergone redefinition over the years, and is now generally understood to refer to certain social characteristics rather than to genetic monogamy. However, even the term ""social monogamy"" is used loosely to refer to species which exhibit a spectrum of social structures, mating patterns, and breeding systems. Papers in this volume address key issues including whether or not our definitions of monogamy should change in order to better represent the social and mating behaviors that characterize wild primates; whether or not primate groups traditionally considered monogamous are actually so (by any definition); ways in which captive studies can contribute to our understanding of monogamy; and what selective pressures might have driven the evolution of monogamous and non-monogamous single female breeding systems.",Animals|Biological Evolution|Pair Bond|Primates|Social Behavior

26288898,Introduction to the Special Issue on Multimodality of Early Sensory Processing: Early Visual Maps Flexibly Encode Multimodal Space.,2015-08-21,"As living organisms, we have the capability to explore our environments through different senses, each making use of specialized organs and returning unique information. This is relayed to a set of cortical areas, each of which appears to be specialized for processing information from a single sense — hence the definition of ‘unisensory’ areas. Many models assume that primary unisensory cortices passively reproduce information from each sensory organ; these then project to associative areas, which actively combine multisensory signals with each other and with cognitive stances. By the same token, the textbook view holds that sensory cortices undergo plastic changes only within a limited ‘critical period’; their function and architecture should remain stable and unchangeable thereafter. This model has led to many fundamental discoveries on the architecture of the sensory systems (e.g., oriented receptive fields, binocularity, topographic maps, to name just the best known). However, a growing body of evidence calls for a review of this conceptual scheme. Based on single-cell recordings from non-human primates, fMRI in humans, psychophysics, and sensory deprivation studies, early sensory areas are losing their status of fixed readouts of receptor activity; they are turning into functional nodes in a network of brain areas that flexibly adapts to the statistics of the input and the behavioral goals.

Currently many issues concern psychiatrists, and does not fill them with optimism: an uncertain future implementation of the National Mental Health Protection Programme, or the recent amendment of criminal law, entering into force on 01.07.2015, on the significant enlargement of implementation of treatment and precautionary measures in psychiatric institutions. Prof. J.K. Gierowski [1] wrote in Psychiatria Polska about the misunderstanding and even conflict in this matter, between politicians, lawyers and psychiatric community, almost one and a half year ago. Several tragic, dramatic events (German Wings plane crash, the recent murder in Tworki) creates a bad social attitude towards the mentally ill. Our environment does not remain indifferent and is actively involved in the discussion - it is expressed by Letters to Editor, written by Elwira Marszałkowska-Krześ and Andrzej Brodziak, published in the current issue of the magazine. We are all aware of our responsibility - on the one hand for a safe environment for patients while ensuring adequate treatment to the ill, and on the other for creating the image of psychiatry and psychiatrists [2, 3].

Modern ostracism research started in the early 1990s and hundreds of studies have advanced our understanding of this phenomenon. However, the preponderance of research has focused on the target of ostracism (those being ostracized) and relied primarily on a single method in experimental studies. The present special issue includes articles that employed a variety of research approaches and focused exclusively on the sources (those who do the ostracism). Finally, this commentary invites researchers to more fully investigate this understudied aspect of a common phenomenon that people are likely to engage in regularly.",Humans|Social Isolation

In much of this work, mindfulness is understood as a mode of awareness that is present-centered and nonevaluative. This form of awareness is assumed to have intrinsic value in promoting positive mental health and adaptation by interrupting discursive thoughts that give rise to suffering. However, in the societies where it originated, mindfulness meditation is part of a larger system of Buddhist belief and practice with strong ethical and moral dimensions. Extracting techniques like mindfulness meditation from the social contexts in which they originate may change the nature and effects of the practice. The papers in this issue of Transcultural Psychiatry explore the implications of a cultural and contextual view of mindfulness for continued dialogue between Buddhist thought and psychiatry. This introductory essay considers the meanings of mindfulness meditation in cultural context and the uses of mindfulness as a therapeutic intervention in contemporary psychiatry and psychology.",Awareness|Buddhism|Humans|Meditation|Mindfulness|Religion and Psychology

Such conditions can be chronically disabling and confer significant long-term impairment. Determining early risk signs and first emerging symptoms of disorder is imperative to enhance early detection and to identify targets and ideal time points for prevention and intervention efforts. This Special Issue of JCPP focuses on the prospect of earlier identification of conditions that are traditionally diagnosed later in childhood. Ten invited empirical articles cover topics related to the science of early detection. Several are focused on prediction of later diagnosis, of functional impairment, and of future service utilization, while others cover instrument development and topics related to screening. The papers span the conditions of ADHD, ASD, dyslexia, mood dysregulation, disruptive behavior disorders, and anxiety disorders. This Editorial provides an overview of the invited contributions and the perspectives they provide on the ethical challenges and choices of a field still in its infancy.","Anxiety Disorders|Child|Early Diagnosis|Ethics, Medical|Humans|Mood Disorders|Neurodevelopmental Disorders"

Insects (hexapods) and crustaceans are historically grouped under separate taxonomic classes within the Phylum Arthropoda, and the research communities studying hexapods and crustaceans are quite distinct. More recently, the hexapods have been shown to be evolutionarily derived from basal crustaceans, and the clade Pancrustacea recognizes this relationship. This recent evolutionary perspective, and the fact that the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology has strong communities in both invertebrate biology and insect physiology, provides the motivation for this symposium. Speakers in this symposium were selected because of their expertise in a particular field of insect or crustacean physiology, and paired in such a way as to provide a comparative view of the state of the current research in their respective fields. Presenters discussed what aspects of the physiological system are clearly conserved across insects and crustaceans and how cross-talk between researchers utilizing insects and crustaceans can fertilize understanding of such conserved systems. Speakers were also asked to identify strategies that would enable improved understanding of the evolution of physiological systems of the terrestrial insects from the aquatic crustaceans.

Initially, randomly placed electrodes and stimulation of parts of the living brain were used to localize specific functions to these areas. Recent technical developments have rejuvenated this approach by providing more precise tools to dissect the neural circuits underlying behaviour, perception and cognition. Carefully controlled behavioural experiments have been combined with electrical devices, targeted genetically encoded tools and neurochemical approaches to manipulate information processing in the brain. The ability to control brain activity in these ways not only deepens our understanding of brain function but also provides new avenues for clinical intervention, particularly in conditions where brain processing has gone awry.",Animals|Behavior|Brain|Brain Mapping|Cognition|Electric Stimulation|Humans

Using theoretical ideas from emotional and relational geographies and critical understandings of salutogenesis, the value of blue space to health and wellbeing is recognised and evaluated. Six individual papers from five different countries consider how health can be enabled in mixed blue space settings. Four sub-themes; embodiment, inter-subjectivity, activity and meaning, document multiple experiences within a range of healthy blue spaces. Finally, we suggest a considerable research agenda - theoretical, methodological and applied - for future work within different forms of blue space.

23326343",A dual-axis approach to understanding neuroendocrine development.,2015-07-30,"This introduction sets out to present a series of paper about a novel perspective regarding stress and sex hormones, or what the authors within this special issue term ""coupling"" of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal and--gonadal axes. This view postulates that these axes do not necessarily operate in opposition, but can operate together as evidenced empirically as a positive within-person association between stress hormones like cortisol or sex hormones like testosterone. A wealth of papers within the special issue demonstrate positive coupling across acute, diurnal, basal, and longitudinal timeframes and across several different types of contexts. Reviews were meant to challenge whether this was physiologically plausible. Consistently, sophisticated statistical models were utilized in order to show a template for how to model positive coupling and to ensure that coupling was a within-person phenomenon. We cautiously considered positive coupling until the consistency of observing coupling was robust enough for us to consider challenging the prevailing oppositional view of these axes. We do so to acknowledge that there are contexts, moments and stages in which the function of these axes should work together: for example when contexts are both stressful and challenging or at developmental stages (like adolescence) in which the youth must grow up despite the storm and stress of youth. We hope that by putting forward a functional dual-axis approach, the field will be able to consider when and how these axes work together.",Adolescent|Adolescent Development|Gonadal Hormones|Humans|Hydrocortisone|Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System|Pituitary-Adrenal System|Sexual Development

16501184",Robust detection of heart beats in multimodal data.,2015-07-29,"This editorial reviews the background issues, the design, the key achievements, and the follow-up research generated as a result of the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology (CinC) Challenge 2014, published in the concurrent focus issue of Physiological Measurement. Our major focus was to accelerate the development and facilitate the comparison of robust methods for locating heart beats in long-term multi-channel recordings. A public (training) database consisting of 151 032 annotated beats was compiled from records that contained ECGs as well as pulsatile signals that directly reflect cardiac activity, and other signals that may have few or no observable markers of heart beats. A separate hidden test data set (consisting of 152 478 beats) is permanently stored at PhysioNet, and a public framework has been developed to provide researchers with the ability to continue to automatically score and compare the performance of their algorithms. A scoring criteria based on the averaging of gross sensitivity, gross positive predictivity, average sensitivity, and average positive predictivity is proposed. The top three scores (as of March 2015) on the hidden test data set were 93.64%, 91.50%, and 90.70%.","Algorithms|Databases, Factual|Heart|Heart Function Tests|Heart Rate|Humans|Sensitivity and Specificity|Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted"

26205202,Charting the history of agricultural experiments.,2015-07-25,"Agricultural experimentation is a world in constant evolution, spanning multiple scientific domains and affecting society at large. Even though the questions underpinning agricultural experiments remain largely the same, the instruments and practices for answering them have changed constantly during the twentieth century with the advent of new disciplines like molecular biology, genomics, statistics, and computing. Charting this evolving reality requires a mapping of the affinities and antinomies at work within the realm of agricultural research, and a consideration of the practices, tools and social and political structures in which agricultural experiments are grounded. Three main questions will be addressed to provide an overview of the complex world of agricultural research investigated by the special issue: What is an agricultural experiment? Who is an experimenter in agriculture? Where do agricultural experiments take place? It will become apparent that agricultural experiments have a wide relevance for human development as they touch upon concerns related to human health and nutrition, contribute to policy discussions, and can affect the social and political structures in which farming is embedded.","Agriculture|History, 19th Century|History, 20th Century|History, 21st Century|United Kingdom"

The outbreaks of the vaccine-preventable diseases (e.g., measles) and the emerging pathogens (e.g., Ebola) show us how small the world has become. These outbreaks also show the pressing need for effective public education and development of novel therapies. This issue covers various aspects of relevant therapeutic topics ranging from preclinical models, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, pharmacogenomics, and clinical trial results, to education efforts in this area. Pharmacokinetic/dynamic modeling had an appreciable role in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus, recent emerging infections. However, these gains could be lessened by poor adherence to therapies, which has contributed to the development of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.

The adverse effects of diabetes and obesity on cognitive functioning are increasingly well recognized. This special issue of Psychosomatic Medicine features the latest research linking diabetes, obesity, and brain structure, function, and metabolism and follows a special meeting on this topic organized by the American Psychosomatic Society in October 2013. Evidence for the increased prevalence of diabetes and obesity is reviewed as it relates to cognitive decline. These articles indicate that the age of onset of Type 1 diabetes may be relevant to future cognitive function and that disease duration of Type 2 diabetes and sociocultural factors are related to cognitive decline during the aging process. The hypothalamus and other neural circuits, notably the dopaminergic system that underlies feeding and reward-related aspects of food intake, are among the key factors involved in obesity. Research on the associations between obesity and cognitive function is described using the positive effects of weight reduction following bariatric surgery or behavioral methods. This special issue concludes with a conceptual framework for linking obesity and diabetes with accelerated cognitive decline as related to the aging process. The collection of articles highlights the importance of using a life span perspective to understand the influence of both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes on brain metabolism, function, and structure. Moreover, these studies show that distressing environmental circumstances can adversely influence neurocognitive dysfunction associated with obesity and diabetes.","Behavioral Medicine|Brain|Cognition Disorders|Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1|Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2|Humans|Obesity"

What we have learned in the 50 years since its discovery is that, in addition to these primary functions, the PTS serves as a complex protein kinase system that regulates a wide variety of transport, metabolic and mutagenic processes as well as the expression of numerous genes. Recent operon- and genome-sequencing projects have revealed novel PTS protein-encoding genes, many of which have yet to be functionally defined. The current picture of the PTS is that of a complex system with ramifications in all aspects of cellular physiology. Moreover, its mosaic evolutionary history is unusual and intriguing. The PTS can be considered to serve many prokaryotes in capacities of communication and coordination, as do the nervous systems of animals.","Bacteria|Escherichia coli|Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial|Genes, Bacterial|Multigene Family|Operon|Phosphoenolpyruvate Sugar Phosphotransferase System|Phosphorylation|Phosphotransferases"

26002527",Introduction to desiccation biology: from old borders to new frontiers.,2015-07-05,"A special issue reviews the recent progress made in our understanding of desiccation tolerance across various plant and animal kingdoms. It has been known for a long time that seeds can survive near absolute protoplasmic dehydration through air drying and complete germination upon rehydration because of their desiccation tolerance. This property is present both in prokaryotes and eukaryotes across all life kingdoms. These dry organisms suspend their metabolism when dry, are extremely tolerant to acute environmental stresses and are relatively stable during long periods of desiccation. Studies aiming at understanding the mechanisms of survival in the dry state have emerged during the past 40 years, moving from in vitro to genomic models and comparative genomics, and from a view that tolerance is an all-or-nothing phenomenon to a quantitative trait. With the prospect of global climate change, understanding the mechanisms of desiccation tolerance appears to be a promising avenue as a prelude to engineering crops for improved drought tolerance. Understanding desiccation is also useful for seed banks that rely on dehydration tolerance to preserve plant genetic resources in the form of these propagules. Articles in this special issue explore the recent progress in our understanding of desiccation tolerance, including the evolutionary mechanisms that have been adopted across various plant (algae, lichens, seeds, resurrection plants) and animal model systems (Caenorhabditis elegans, brine shrimp). We propose that the term desiccation biology defines the discipline dedicated to understand the desiccation tolerance in living organisms as well as the limits and time constraints thereof.","Adaptation, Physiological|Biological Evolution|Desiccation|Plants"

25329886",Health Information Technology Challenges to Support Patient-Centered Care Coordination.,2015-07-01,"To provide an editorial introduction to the 2015 IMIA Yearbook of Medical Informatics.
We provide a brief overview of the 2015 special topic ""Patient-Centered Care Coordination"", discuss the addition of two new sections to the Yearbook, Natural Language Processing and Public Health & Epidemiology Informatics, and present our editorial plans for the upcoming celebration of the 25th anniversary of the Yearbook.
Care delivery currently occurs through the processing of complex clinical pathways designed for increasingly multi-morbid patients by various practitioners in different settings. To avoid the consequences of the fragmentation of services, care should be organized to coordinate all providers, giving them the opportunity to share the same holistic view of the patient's condition, and to be informed of the planned clinical pathway that establishes the roles and interventions of each one. The adoption and use of electronic health records (EHRs) is a solution to address health information sharing and care coordination challenges. However, while EHRs are necessary, they are not sufficient to achieve care coordination, creating information availability does not mean the information will be accessed. This edition of the Yearbook acknowledges the fact that health information technology (HIT), and EHRs in particular, are not yet fully addressing the challenges in care coordination. Emerging trends, tools, and applications of HIT to support care coordination are presented through the keynote paper, survey papers, and working group contributions.
In 2015, the IMIA Yearbook has been extended to emphasize two fields of biomedical informatics through new sections. Next year, the 25th anniversary of the Yearbook will be celebrated in grand style! A special issue with a touch of reflection, a bit of rediscovery, and some ""science-fiction"" will be published in addition to the usual edition.",Anniversaries and Special Events|Humans|Medical Informatics|Patient Care Management|Patient-Centered Care|Periodicals as Topic
26123367,SYRA3 COST Action--Microbeam radiation therapy: Roots and prospects.,2015-07-01,"Microbeam radiation therapy (MRT) is an irradiation modality for therapeutic purposes which uses arrays of collimated quasi parallel microbeams, each up to 100 μm wide, to deliver high radiation doses. Several studies have reported the extraordinary tolerance of normal tissues to MRT irradiation; conversely, MRT has been shown to be highly efficient on tumor growth control. The original and most widely developed application of MRT, yet in the preclinical phase, consists in using spatially fractionated X-ray beams issued from a synchrotron radiation source in the treatment of brain tumors. More recently, MRT has been tested in successful pioneering assays to reduce or interrupt seizures in preclinical models of epilepsy. The MRT concept has also been extended to proton therapy. The development of MRT towards its clinical implementation is presently driven by an EU-supported consortium of laboratories from 16 countries within the COST Action TD1205 (SYRA3). The results of the first SYRA3 workshop on ""Radiation Therapy with Synchrotron Radiation: Achievements and Challenges"" held in Krakow (Poland) during March 25-26 2014 are summarized in this issue with an overview presented in this paper. The papers reflect the multidisciplinary international activities of SYRA3. The topics covered in this focus issue include medical physics aspects, pre-clinical studies, clinical applications, and an industrial perspective; finally an outlook towards future prospects of compact sources and proton microbeams.","Dose Fractionation, Radiation|Proton Therapy|Radiosurgery|Radiotherapy Dosage|Radiotherapy, High-Energy|Radiotherapy, Image-Guided|Synchrotrons"

26118306,Introduction to the special issue on Cognitive bias modification: Taking a step back to move forward?,2015-06-30,"Cognitive bias modification (CBM) research holds important theoretical and clinical potential. CBM represents one of the most exciting translational developments in experimental psychopathology research in recent years. Despite theoretical and methodological advances in the past 15 years, the clinical efficacy of CBM, to-date, has been disappointing. However, it is important to remember that the CBM therapeutics literature is only in its early stages of scientific development. We argue that the potential for novel approaches to CBM to contribute to disseminable psychological interventions is strong and has yet to be realized. Accordingly, we propose 5 inter-related steps that may help advance the basic and clinical science of CBM: (1) Innovation and refinement of the methodology to modify information-processing bias; (2) Advancing understanding of the nature of processing biases in order to guide their modification; (3) Conceptualizing and studying the moderating and mediating mechanisms underlying the modification of information-processing bias and their effects on maladaptation; (4) Focus on augmenting existing validated treatments, by targeting psychobehavioral processes proximally linked to information-processing biases; (5) Encouraging publication of methodologically strong, mixed and unexpected findings. Finally, we introduce papers in the special issue with respect to each of these future directions. These papers provide important new conceptual and methodological perspectives to advance CBM research.",Attention|Bias|Decision Making|Humans|Judgment|Mental Disorders|Psychotherapy

15766928",Fungal stress biology: a preface to the Fungal Stress Responses special edition.,2015-06-28,"There is currently an urgent need to increase global food security, reverse the trends of increasing cancer rates, protect environmental health, and mitigate climate change. Toward these ends, it is imperative to improve soil health and crop productivity, reduce food spoilage, reduce pesticide usage by increasing the use of biological control, optimize bioremediation of polluted sites, and generate energy from sustainable sources such as biofuels. This review focuses on fungi that can help provide solutions to such problems. We discuss key aspects of fungal stress biology in the context of the papers published in this Special Issue of Current Genetics. This area of biology has relevance to pure and applied research on fungal (and indeed other) systems, including biological control of insect pests, roles of saprotrophic fungi in agriculture and forestry, mycotoxin contamination of the food-supply chain, optimization of microbial fermentations including those used for bioethanol production, plant pathology, the limits of life on Earth, and astrobiology.","Adaptation, Biological|Fungi|Stress, Physiological"
26113667,Thinking about Change: An Integrative Approach for Examining Cognition in a Changing World.,2015-06-27,"We are currently experiencing shifts in climate at rates not previously recorded. One important aspect of this change is a tendency toward extremes--extremes in temperature and moisture, both within and among years. Numerous studies focus on the physiological consequences of environmental change, especially in terms of ectothermic taxa's thermal regime and use of habitat. For many species, though, cognitive responses may be a means of response to environmental perturbation. However, the effects of environmental change on the general mechanisms of cognitive processes and their implications for larger phenomena are seldom examined. Moreover, at a larger scale, we do not fully understand the features of the environment that might select for cognitive enhancements or their mechanisms, making us unable to accurately predict which species might experience the most severe response to environmental change and in which environments. This symposium brought together scientists from numerous disciplines to examine the role of cognition in how organisms cope with changing environments. We cover topics from the perspectives of the physiological mechanisms underlying and driving cognition to the complexity of individual behavioral responses in changing environments to emergent large-scale processes influencing species' abilities to respond to such change. Our ultimate goals are to explore how animals use cognition to cope with rapid environmental change, how such coping mechanisms ""scale up"" to affect ecological and evolutionary patterns, and how we might determine which features of the environment have been (and will become) most important for the conservation of biodiversity.",Animals|Climate Change|Cognition|Environment|Humans

26209546",Effort-Based Decision Making in Schizophrenia: Evaluation of Paradigms to Measure Motivational Deficits.,2015-06-26,"Effort-based decision making requires one to decide how much effort to expend for a certain amount of reward. As the amount of reward goes up most people are willing to exert more effort. This relationship between reward level and effort expenditure can be measured in specialized performance-based tasks that have only recently been applied to schizophrenia. Such tasks provide a way to measure objectively motivational deficits in schizophrenia, which now are only assessed with clinical interviews of negative symptoms. The articles in this theme provide reviews of the relevant animal and human literatures (first 2 articles), and then a psychometric evaluation of 5 effort-based decision making paradigms (last 2 articles). This theme section is intended to stimulate interest in this emerging area among basic scientists developing paradigms for preclinical studies, human experimentalists trying to disentangle factors that contribute to performance on effort-based tasks, and investigators looking for objective endpoints for clinical trials of negative symptoms in schizophrenia.",Animals|Decision Making|Humans|Motivation|Psychomotor Performance|Schizophrenia

26090588,Late-life anxiety is coming of age.,2015-06-20,"Anxiety is an adaptive human experience that may occur at all ages and serves to help draw attention to, avoid or cope with immanent threat and danger. Given its evolutionary importance, it has strong genetic and biological underpinnings, and when it serves that adaptive function for the organism, anxiety may be viewed as useful. However, complex adaptive systems, such as our adaptation to threat or stress, by definition provide many and often interrelated points of breakdown or dysregulation, which, if sustained, may lead to psychopathology. Anxiety has been described as a common currency for psychopathology, indicating that it is a first line and universal way for us to respond to stress and threat. It is more or less prominent in patients diagnosed with practically all psychiatric or neurodegenerative disorders. This has lead to the inclusion of anxiety as a cross-cutting symptom measure in the development of DSM-5 (APA, 2013). Given that they are rooted in a complex adaptive system that has many potential points of impact to develop pathology, it is not surprising that anxiety disorders are extremely heterogeneous. This heterogeneity of anxiety disorders pertains to symptomatology, etiology and outcomes, and poses great challenges to both research and clinical practice.","Adaptation, Psychological|Aged|Aged, 80 and over|Anxiety|Anxiety Disorders|Humans|Middle Aged|Psychopathology"

21990244",Peto's paradox and the promise of comparative oncology.,2015-06-10,"The past several decades have seen a paradigm shift with the integration of evolutionary thinking into studying cancer. The evolutionary lens is most commonly employed in understanding cancer emergence, tumour growth and metastasis, but there is an increasing realization that cancer defences both between tissues within the individual and between species have been influenced by natural selection. This special issue focuses on discoveries of these deeper evolutionary phenomena in the emerging area of 'comparative oncology'. Comparing cancer dynamics in different tissues or species can lead to insights into how biology and ecology have led to differences in carcinogenesis, and the diversity, incidence and lethality of cancers. In this introduction to the special issue, we review the history of the field and outline how the contributions use empirical, comparative and theoretical approaches to address the processes and patterns associated with 'Peto's paradox', the lack of a statistical relationship of cancer incidence with body size and longevity. This burgeoning area of research can help us understand that cancer is not only a disease but is also a driving force in biological systems and species life histories. Comparative oncology will be key to understanding globally important health issues, including cancer epidemiology, prevention and improved therapies.","Animals|Biological Evolution|Body Size|Cocarcinogenesis|Female|Humans|Longevity|Male|Mammals|Models, Biological|Neoplasms"

25618446",Turning Over a New Leaf: Cannabinoid and Endocannabinoid Modulation of Immune Function.,2015-06-10,"Cannabis is a complex substance that harbors terpenoid-like compounds referred to as phytocannabinoids. The major psychoactive phytocannabinoid found in cannabis ∆(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) produces the majority of its pharmacological effects through two cannabinoid receptors, termed CB1 and CB2. The discovery of these receptors as linked functionally to distinct biological effects of THC, and the subsequent development of synthetic cannabinoids, precipitated discovery of the endogenous cannabinoid (or endocannabinoid) system. This system consists of the endogenous lipid ligands N- arachidonoylethanolamine (anandamide; AEA) and 2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG), their biosynthetic and degradative enzymes, and the CB1 and CB2 receptors that they activate. Endocannabinoids have been identified in immune cells such as monocytes, macrophages, basophils, lymphocytes, and dendritic cells and are believed to be enzymatically produced and released ""on demand"" in a similar fashion as the eicosanoids. It is now recognized that other phytocannabinoids such as cannabidiol (CBD) and cannabinol (CBN) can alter the functional activities of the immune system. This special edition of the Journal of Neuroimmune Pharmacology (JNIP) presents a collection of cutting edge original research and review articles on the medical implications of phytocannabinoids and the endocannabinoid system. The goal of this special edition is to provide an unbiased assessment of the state of research related to this topic from leading researchers in the field. The potential untoward effects as well as beneficial uses of marijuana, its phytocannabinoid composition, and synthesized cannabinoid analogs are discussed. In addition, the role of the endocannabinoid system and approaches to its manipulation to treat select human disease processes are addressed.","Animals|Cannabinoids|Endocannabinoids|Humans|Immunomodulation|Nervous System Diseases|Plant Extracts|Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB1"

Insight into epigenetic regulation has transformed understanding of inheritance, development and a broad spectrum of biological processes as well as advances in mechanistic and clinical characterization of tissues and disease states. The dynamics of bone tissue undergoing continuous remodeling during growth and turnover in the adult skeleton, involves epigenetic mechanisms that have emerged as an important component to maintaining skeletal homeostasis. A series of four reviews are presented in the journal BONE covering different aspects of epigenetic control mechanisms that have impacted on the skeleton. Authorship on each of the reviews is shared by investigators from different institutions to present a consensus of emerging concepts and future directions for understanding regulation of the bone epigenome and skeletal pathologies.","Adult|Animals|Bone Development|Bone Remodeling|Bone and Bones|Epigenesis, Genetic|Homeostasis|Humans"

However, to date there is limited evidence on how to monitor patients with asthma. Childhood asthma introduces specific challenges in terms of deciding what, when, how often, by whom and in whom different assessments of asthma should be performed. The age of the child, the fluctuating course of asthma severity, variability in clinical presentation, exacerbations, comorbidities, socioeconomic and psychosocial factors, and environmental exposures may all influence disease activity and, hence, monitoring strategies. These factors will be addressed in herein. We identified large knowledge gaps in the effects of different monitoring strategies in children with asthma.

24293464",Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension: the evolving treatment landscape.,2015-06-02,"Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is a unique form of pulmonary hypertension (PH) arising from the obstruction of pulmonary arterial vessels by organised thromboembolic material [1]. Much like other forms of PH, CTEPH has historically proven to be a challenging clinical entity in that it is frequently underdiagnosed and undertreated [1–3]. This lack of clinical recognition can result in patients with CTEPH experiencing progressive PH and eventual right ventricular failure [1, 4].","Angioplasty, Balloon|Antihypertensive Agents|Arterial Pressure|Endarterectomy|History, 20th Century|History, 21st Century|Humans|Hypertension, Pulmonary|Pulmonary Artery|Pulmonary Embolism|Pyrazoles|Pyrimidines|Treatment Outcome"
26027809,Editorial: Prevention Strategies Targeting Different Preclinical Stages of Alzheimer's Disease.,2015-06-02,"The incidence of dementia is rapidly increasing not only in developed countries but also in developing countries with rising aging populations. This trend is expected to worsen, with the number of cases possibly tripling in the coming decades. Over the last few decades, epidemiological studies have revealed that vascular-or lifestyle-related factors are associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia. Researches into the pathophysiological processes of AD have revealed that the pathological brain lesions of AD begin decades before the onset of symptoms. Many prevention studies have indicated that physical activity and/or mental training can improve cognition and daily life in subjects with AD or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, issues with early detection and preclinical staging and effective preventive approaches that are based on these stages remain unresolved. Therefore, we propose different strategies for AD prevention based on its preclinical stages: one involves physical and mental training that targets the risk factors in subjects without pathophysiological changes, and the second approach combines nonpharmacological and pharmacological methods and aims to treat MCI in individuals with amyloid deposits and/or neurodegeneration with drugs that target the amyloid cascade. The results of several ongoing and promising trials are expected in the next few years.","Alzheimer Disease|Animals|Dementia|Disease Progression|Early Diagnosis|Humans|Translational Research, Biomedical"
26026376,Interplay among cytokines and T cell subsets in the progression and control of immune-mediated diseases.,2015-06-01,"Cytokines serve as key mediators of inflammation and tissue damage in a variety of immune-mediated disorders. The induction, progression, and resolution of inflammation in such disorders are characterized by a dynamic balance between both the pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines as well as the pathogenic and protective T cell subsets. Over the past two decades, the roles of the interleukin-17 (IL-17) /IL-23 axis and the T helper 17 (Th17)/ T regulatory (Treg) cell balance in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity and other inflammatory diseases have extensively been analyzed, and their significance validated. However, these studies, coupled with others devoted to well-established Th1/Th2 cytokines, have unraveled some challenging issues including the dual action of cytokines and the plasticity of T cell subsets. Nevertheless, major positive advances have also been made regarding cytokines and T cell subsets as therapeutic targets/agents. In this special issue, ""Cytokines in Immune Pathology and Therapy,"" leading experts have shared their research work and perspectives on the roles of cytokines in the development and control of immune-mediated diseases. An outline of 14 articles in the first volume is presented here. The second volume will follow soon.","Autoimmune Diseases|Autoimmunity|Cytokines|Disease Progression|Humans|Immune System Diseases|Inflammation|Interleukin-17|Interleukin-23|T-Lymphocyte Subsets|T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory|Th1 Cells|Th17 Cells"
26022560,Introduction to the supplement.,2015-05-30,"In July of 2014, a symposium entitled ""Enhancing Vaccine Immunity and Value"" was held in Siena, Italy. The focus of the symposium was on how to best meet the challenge of developing and implementing vaccines for future disease targets. Vaccination has been responsible for averting estimated 3 billion cases of disease and more than 500 million lives to date through the prevention of infectious diseases. This has largely been responsible for dramatic increases in life span in developed countries. However, with the demographics of the world's population are changing, with many adults now surviving into their 80s, we now face the challenge of protecting the aging and other underserved populations not only against infectious diseases but also against cancer and other chronic conditions that occur in older adults. To face this challenge, we must harness new technologies derived from recent advances in the fields of immunology, structural biology, synthetic biology and genomics that promise a revolution in the vaccine field. Specifically, vaccine adjuvants have the potential to harness the immune system to provide protection against new types of diseases, improve protection in young children and expand this protection to adults and the elderly. However, in order to succeed, we need to overcome the non-technical challenges that could limit the implementation of innovative vaccines, including controversies regarding the safety of adjuvants, increasing regulatory complexity, the inadequate methods used to assess the value of novel vaccines, and the resulting industry alienation from future investment. In this supplement, we have assembled manuscripts from lectures and discussions of the symposium last July that addressed two related questions: how to improve vaccine efficacy using breakthrough technologies and how to capture the full potential of novel vaccines.","Adjuvants, Immunologic|Clinical Studies as Topic|Drug Discovery|Humans|Vaccination|Vaccines"

Gruhle (1913): Introduction by Johan Schioldann and German Berrios: Translation by Johan Schioldann.",2015-05-30,"At the beginning of the 20th century there took place in German Psychiatry an important debate on the nature and relative importance of mental symptoms and diseases. Young psychiatrists such as Störring, Ziehen, Gaupp, Hoche, Jaspers and Gruhle challenged, from various perspectives, the nosology of established figures such as Kraepelin and Wernicke. The Classic Text is a commented translation of Gruhle's 1913 lecture on the meaning of mental symptoms. After concluding that mental symptoms should be used as the epistemological unit of analysis in psychiatry, Gruhle rued the fact that little was yet known about their inner structure. He believed that any account of the latter should include an account of the 'meaning' of mental symptoms, that is, of their role in the patient's total disease. Gruhle found Freud's account of meaning wanting, but was himself unable to offer a viable alternative. Be that as it may, his concern remains unanswered and is as relevant today as it was in 1913.","Germany|History, 21st Century|Humans|Mental Disorders|Psychiatry|Symptom Assessment"
26022295,Ring-tailed lemurs: a species re-imagined.,2015-05-30,"For over 50 years, ring-tailed lemurs have been studied continuously in the wild. As one of the most long-studied primate species, the length and breadth of their study is comparable to research on Japanese macaques, baboons and chimpanzees. They are also one of the most broadly observed of all primates, with comprehensive research conducted on their behaviour, biology, ecology, genetics, palaeobiology and life history. However, over the last decade, a new generation of lemur scholars, working in conjunction with researchers who have spent decades studying this species, have greatly enhanced our knowledge of ring-tailed lemurs. In addition, research on this species has expanded beyond traditional gallery forest habitats to now include high altitude, spiny thicket, rocky outcrop and anthropogenically disturbed coastal forest populations. The focus of this special volume is to 're-imagine' the 'flagship species of Madagascar', bringing together three generations of lemur scholars.","Animals|Behavior, Animal|Diet|Ecosystem|Lemur|Madagascar"

19436771",Genetic Influences on Peer and Family Relationships Across Adolescent Development: Introduction to the Special Issue.,2015-05-27,"Nearly all aspects of human development are influenced by genetic and environmental factors, which conjointly shape development through several gene-environment interplay mechanisms. More recently, researchers have begun to examine the influence of genetic factors on peer and family relationships across the pre-adolescent and adolescent time periods. This article introduces the special issue by providing a critical overview of behavior genetic methodology and existing research demonstrating gene-environment processes operating on the link between peer and family relationships and adolescent adjustment. The overview is followed by a summary of new research studies, which use genetically informed samples to examine how peer and family environment work together with genetic factors to influence behavioral outcomes across adolescence. The studies in this special issue provide further evidence of gene-environment interplay through innovative behavior genetic methodological approaches across international samples. Results from the quantitative models indicate environmental moderation of genetic risk for coercive adolescent-parent relationships and deviant peer affiliation. The molecular genetics studies provide support for a gene-environment interaction differential susceptibility model for dopamine regulation genes across positive and negative peer and family environments. Overall, the findings from the studies in this special issue demonstrate the importance of considering how genes and environments work in concert to shape developmental outcomes during adolescence.","Adolescent|Adolescent Behavior|Antisocial Personality Disorder|Family Relations|Female|Genetic Predisposition to Disease|Genetics, Behavioral|Humans|Male|Models, Genetic|Peer Group|Social Behavior Disorders"
26003235,Introduction.,2015-05-25,"This volume of the Handbook of Clinical Neurology deals with neurologic disorders of sex and bladder. Sexuality is for the large majority of humans a component of a fulfilled life, even though it is not ""vital"" in the usual sense of the word. However, dysfunctions of the lower urinary tract (LUT) are vital, as they may lead to chronic infection, dilatation of the upper urinary tract, renal insufficiency, and death. Sexual disorders and LUT are often mentioned in ancient literature, but most contemporary methods of diagnosis and treatment were only introduced in the 20th century. Despite the relatively high prevalence of these disorders, most physicians are ill prepared to discuss them with their patients, let alone to diagnose and treat them. It is the aim of this volume of the Handbook to try to reverse this attitude and convince neurologists that sexual and LUT function need to be addressed in their patients, for reasons of correct diagnosis and possible therapeutic consequences, as well as gaining overall trust from the patient.","Female|Humans|Male|Nervous System Diseases|Sexual Dysfunction, Physiological|Urologic Diseases"
26003049,"Time, space and the vertebrate body axis.",2015-05-25,"Anterior-posterior (A-P) patterning of the vertebrate main body axis regulated by timing. Anterior structures are specified early, posterior late. (1) Timing involves timed decision points as emphasised by the Wnt studies of Sokol and colleagues. It also involves complex timers, where large parts of the axis are patterned sequentially by a common upstream mechanism (articles by Durston et al., Mullins et al., Oates et al.,). (2) A gastrula BMP-anti BMP dependent time-space translation (TST) mechanism was demonstrated for the trunk section of the axis (Durston). (3) Thisses' studies emphasise the importance of BMP-anti BMP and the organiser inducing factor nodal for A-P patterning. (4) Meinhardt's interesting studies on the organiser and A-P patterning are reviewed in relation to TST. (5) Mullins' investigations show that anti-BMP dependent TST starts earlier (at the blastula stage) and extends further anteriorly (to the anterior head). Sive's studies imply it may extend further still to the ""extreme anterior domain"" (EAD). (6) The somitogenesis timer (clock) is presented. Stern's and Oates' findings are discussed. (7) Relations between somitogenesis and axial TST are discussed. (8) Relations of classical axial patterning pathways to TST decision points and somitogenesis are inventarised. In conclusion, all of these findings point to an integral BMP-anti BMP dependent A-P TST mechanism, running from cement gland in the EAD, Six3 and the anterior tip of the forebrain at blastula stages to Hox13 and the tip of the tail by the mid neurula stage. TST acts via sequential timed transitions between ventral (unstable, timed) and dorsal (stabilised) states. In the trunk-tail, the timer is thought to be Hox temporal collinearity and TST depends on Hox function. In the head, TST is under investigation. The somitogenesis clock is upstream of the TST timer, providing precision in the posterior part of the axis at least. Classical A-P signalling pathways: retinoids, FGFs and Wnts, change behaviour at functional decision points on the axis.",Animals|Body Patterning|Embryonic Development|Signal Transduction|Vertebrates
25998629,The anatomy of the mummy: mortui viventes docent--when ancient mummies speak to modern doctors.,2015-05-23,"There is almost a universal fascination with prehistoric, protohistoric, and historic human remains that preserve the soft tissues (nonskeletal) of the body (general definition of a mummy). While most people within the general public engage with mummies as part of a museum exhibit process, many scientists have taken that fascination much further. Starting as a general fascination with mummification, the scientific process involved in the study of mummies began in earnest in the late 18th Century AD. This issue of the Anatomical Record was conceived and formulated to bring together a series of researchers to highlight their most groundbreaking research on the scientific advances that surround the 21st Century AD study of these preserved biological beings including an illumination of the cultural processes that purposefully or inadvertently are preserved either within their tissues or are present within the context (archaeological) in which they are found (excavated).

25994947,Broadening the definition of autoinflammation.,2015-05-23,"Initially, the concept of autoinflammation posited that there be no involvement of autoreactive B or T cells, and no evidence of infection. These criteria served well to help establish the concept, and distinguish autoinflammatory diseases from autoimmune or infectious conditions. However, the characterisation of additional monogenic autoinflammatory diseases has established that a primary trigger of the innate immune system may also be accompanied by infection or manifestations of autoimmunity, which may even contribute to pathogenesis. This issue of Seminars in Immunopathology draws out these themes and also shows how autoinflammation can help to maintain homeostasis, which is its primary evolutionary function. Elucidating the fundamental innate immune pathways underlying autoinflammatory disease leads back to these same homeostatic parameters, to inform about how infection is sensed, and providing for new targets against chronic inflammatory disease.",Autoimmune Diseases|Hereditary Autoinflammatory Diseases|Humans|Inflammation
25991694,Livestock models in translational medicine.,2015-05-21,"This issue of the ILAR Journal focuses on livestock models in translational medicine. Livestock models of selected human diseases present important advantages as compared with rodent models for translating fundamental breakthroughs in biology to useful preventatives and therapeutics for humans. Livestock reflect the complexity of applying medical advances in an outbred species. In many cases, the pathogenesis of infectious, metabolic, genetic, and neoplastic diseases in livestock species more closely resembles that in humans than does the pathogenesis of rodent models. Livestock models also provide the advantage of similar organ size and function and the ability to serially sample an animal throughout the study period. Research using livestock models for human disease often benefits not only human health but animal health and food production as well. This issue of the ILAR Journal presents information on translational research using livestock models in two broad areas: microbiology and infectious disease (transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, mycobacterial infections, influenza A virus infection, vaccine development and testing, the human microbiota) and metabolic, neoplastic, and genetic disorders (stem cell therapy, male germ line cell biology, pulmonary adenocarcinoma, muscular dystrophy, wound healing). In addition, there is a manuscript devoted to Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees' responsibilities for reviewing research using livestock models. Conducting translational research using livestock models requires special facilities and researchers with expertise in livestock. There are many institutions in the world with experienced researchers and facilities designed for livestock research; primarily associated with colleges of agriculture and veterinary medicine or government laboratories.","Animals|Genomics|Livestock|Metabolic Diseases|Translational Research, Biomedical"

22536923",Epigenetics and pharmacology.,2015-05-13,"Recent advances in the understanding of gene regulation have shown there to be much more regulation of the genome than first thought, through epigenetic mechanisms. These epigenetic mechanisms are systems that have evolved to either switch off gene activity altogether, or fine-tune any existing genetic activation. Such systems are present in all genes and include chromatin modifications and remodelling, DNA methylation (such as CpG island methylation rates) and histone covalent modifications (e.g. acetylation, methylation), RNA interference by short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). These systems regulate genomic activity 'beyond' simple transcriptional factor inducer or repressor function of genes to generate mRNA. Epigenetic regulation of gene activity has been shown to be important in maintaining normal phenotypic activity of cells, as well as having a role in development and diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's. Newer classes of drugs regulate epigenetic mechanisms to counteract disease states in humans. The reports in this issue describe some advances in epigenetic understanding that relate to human disease, and our ability to control these mechanisms by pharmacological means. Increasingly the importance of epigenetics is being uncovered - it is pharmacology that will have to keep pace.","Acetylation|Alzheimer Disease|CpG Islands|DNA Methylation|Epigenesis, Genetic|Epigenomics|Gene Expression Regulation|Histones|Humans|Neoplasms|Pharmacology|RNA, Untranslated"
25959524,Developmental trajectories in cognitive-behavioral phenotypes: Introduction.,2015-05-12,"Developmental trajectories in behavioral phenotypes are important areas for systematic research and have been for more than 30 years. They interweave several important strands related to human growth: that of individuals born with some form of intellectual impairment or disability (ID); second, the genetics associated with intellectual ability and disability; and third, at the behavioral level, the dynamic expression and variability of specific abnormalities as individuals age. ID, and the genetic disorders that produce ID, were often not well-received by earlier societies. While the inheritance of behavior and intellectual ability has probably been observed throughout human history, the systematic investigation of the inheritance of intellectual ability probably begins with Sir Francis Galton, in his treatise Hereditary Genius in 1869. The dynamic features of ID have its roots in late 19th century developmental psychology and early 20th century pediatrics. Alfred Binet, along with his colleague Theodore Simon, created the first methods of formal intelligence testing of children for the French school system. Scores based on the items administered would then be used to distinguish children who were prepared for enrollment in a standard educational program from those who were not. The confluence of these research topics brings us to the subject of our Special Issue.","Autism Spectrum Disorder|Chromosome Aberrations|Cognition|History, 19th Century|History, 20th Century|History, 21st Century|Humans|Inheritance Patterns|Intellectual Disability|Mutation|Phenotype"

Findings address the design of HIT systems, primarily electronic health records (EHRs), the utility of various functionalities, and implementation strategies that ensure the greatest value. The articles also remind us that, while HIT can support the delivery of care, it is not a panacea. To be effective, functionality needs to be relevant and timely for both the clinician and patient. Prompts and better documentation can improve care, and ""prompt fatigue"" is not inevitable. Information presented within EHRs needs to be actionable. There is an ongoing tension between information overload and the right-and helpful-information. Even the order of presentation of information can make a difference in the outcome. Whether supported by HIT or not, basic tenants of care, such as including the whole care team in trainings, communicating with other providers, and engaging patients, remain essential. The studies in this issue will prove useful for informatics developers, practices and health systems making HIT decisions, and care teams refining HIT to support the needs of their patients.",Attitude of Health Personnel|Documentation|Electronic Health Records|Humans|Medical Informatics|Patient Care Team|Physician-Patient Relations|Primary Health Care|Quality Improvement|United States

A dose escalation study of single-limb perfusion with 0.9% saline was carried out in nine adults with muscular dystrophies under intravenous analgesia. Our study demonstrates that it is feasible and definitely safe to perform high-pressure transvenous perfusion with 0.9% saline up to 35% of limb volume in the upper extremities of young adults with muscular dystrophy. Perfusion at 40% limb volume is associated with short-lived physiological changes in peripheral nerves without clinical correlates in one subject. This study provides the basis for a phase 1/2 clinical trial using pressurized transvenous delivery into upper limbs of nonambulatory patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Furthermore, our results are applicable to other conditions such as limb girdle muscular dystrophy as a method for delivering regional macromolecular therapeutics in high dose to skeletal muscles of the upper extremity.","Adult|Female|Gene Transfer Techniques|Genetic Therapy|Humans|Male|Middle Aged|Muscular Dystrophy, Duchenne|Perfusion|Pressure|Sodium Chloride|Treatment Outcome|Young Adult"

24132894",New Targets for Prevention of Schizophrenia: Is It Time for Interventions in the Premorbid Phase?,2015-05-01,"A number of influences have converged that make this Special Theme Issue timely: ""A New Direction: Considering Developmentally Sensitive Targets for Very Early Intervention in Schizophrenia"". These factors include: 1. the substantial knowledge about premorbid developmental vulnerabilities to psychosis, especially regarding schizophrenia; 2. the promising results emerging from interventions during the clinical high-risk (CHR) phase of psychosis and; 3. the recognition that the CHR period is a relatively late phase of developmental derailment. These factors have together led to a perspective that even earlier intervention is warranted. This paper briefly summarizes the articles comprising the Special Theme including new data on early neurocognitive development, proposed potential targets for psychosocial and psychopharmacological interventions during the premorbid period as early as pregnancy, and ethical challenges. These thought experiments must be empirically tested, and the ethical challenges overcome as posed by the various interventions, which range from relatively low risk, supportive, psychosocial to higher risk, experimental, pharmacological interventions. All of the interventions proposed require careful study of ethics, safety, potential stigma, feasibility, efficacy and tolerability, and the meaning to the people involved.",Early Medical Intervention|Humans|Prodromal Symptoms|Psychotic Disorders|Risk|Schizophrenia
25923823,"Diseases, patients and the epistemology of practice: mapping the borders of health, medicine and care.",2015-04-30,"Last year saw the 20th anniversary edition of JECP, and in the introduction to the philosophy section of that landmark edition, we posed the question: apart from ethics, what is the role of philosophy 'at the bedside'? The purpose of this question was not to downplay the significance of ethics to clinical practice. Rather, we raised it as part of a broader argument to the effect that ethical questions - about what we should do in any given situation - are embedded within whole understandings of the situation, inseparable from our beliefs about what is the case (metaphysics), what it is that we feel we can claim to know (epistemology), as well as the meaning we ascribe to different aspects of the situation or to our perception of it. Philosophy concerns fundamental questions: it is a discipline requiring us to examine the underlying assumptions we bring with us to our thinking about practical problems. Traditional academic philosophers divide their discipline into distinct areas that typically include logic: questions about meaning, truth and validity; ontology: questions about the nature of reality, what exists; epistemology: concerning knowledge; and ethics: how we should live and practice, the nature of value. Any credible attempt to analyse clinical reasoning will require us to think carefully about these types of question and the relationships between them, as they influence our thinking about specific situations and problems. So, the answers to the question we posed, about the role of philosophy at the bedside, are numerous and diverse, and that diversity is illustrated in the contributions to this thematic edition.","Evidence-Based Medicine|Humans|Knowledge|Metaphysics|Philosophy, Medical"

However, regional differences in tick abundance and pathogen infection prevalence result in the inability to assume results from one area are relevant in another. Current local information on tick ranges, infection rates, and human cases is needed to assess tick-borne disease risk in any given region. The Mid-Atlantic Tick Summit III brought together over 100 area experts and researchers to share regional updates on ticks and their associated pathogens. We report some meeting highlights here. Regional meetings foster cross-disciplinary collaborations that benefit the community, and open novel lines of inquiry so that tick-bite risk can be reduced and tick-borne diseases can be treated effectively.",Animals|Arachnid Vectors|Humans|Information Dissemination|Mid-Atlantic Region|Public Health|Tick-Borne Diseases|Ticks

Typhoid fever burden of disease estimates indicate a substantial burden of illness and death in low-resource areas. The World Health Organization has recommended that countries consider the use of typhoid vaccines for high-risk groups and populations, and for outbreak control. Despite this, typhoid vaccines are not widely used in endemic areas. By examining strategies to improve burden of disease data, use of transmission dynamic models, economic evaluations, vaccine strategies, and experiences with typhoid vaccine pilot projects, the papers in this supplement help to plot the path toward rational and wider use of typhoid vaccines.",Humans|Immunization Programs|Salmonella typhi|Typhoid Fever|Typhoid-Paratyphoid Vaccines

25902608,Moderate acute malnutrition: uncovering the known and unknown for more effective prevention and treatment.,2015-04-24,"With a fast-approaching post-Millennium Development Goal era, there is an urgent need to boost global investment in efforts to reduce child malnutrition. Critical to the management of moderate malnutrition, and therefore to the new Sustainable Development Goals, is addressing severe acute malnutrition (SAM) and moderate acute malnutrition (MAM). Despite the considerable difference in the approximate number of children affected by MAM (33 million) compared with SAM (19 million), there is currently no standardized approach to the management of MAM. In partnership with Valid International, the World Food Programme, and the Micronutrient Initiative, the International Atomic Energy Agency hosted the International Symposium on Understanding Moderate Malnutrition in Children for Effective Interventions in Vienna, Austria, 26-29 May 2014. This symposium focused on the management (prevention and treatment) of MAM in children. The symposium convened over 350 participants from 63 countries, the majority of whom represented governments responding to moderate malnutrition in their populations, nearly 70 national and international organizations from the United Nations and nongovernmental sectors, and universities from around the world, as well as donor governments and private-sector entities. The symposium was structured around nine sessions over a 3-day period, progressing from a global analysis of the scale of the problem to recent research findings relevant to designing effective interventions. This Supplement contains a series of papers that summarize the symposium sessions and other fundamental aspects important to improving the management of moderate malnutrition in children.","Acute Disease|Austria|Child Nutrition Disorders|Child, Preschool|Conservation of Natural Resources|Humans|Infant|International Cooperation|Malnutrition|United Nations"

Following activation of a receptor, a subsequent reaction facilitates the regulation of physiology and, ultimately, behavior. However, a growing number of studies report that hormones can influence these events at a previously underappreciated high speed. With the potential to act as neurotransmitters, the definition of a hormone and its mechanisms of action are evolving. In this symposium, we united scientists who use contemporary molecular, electrophysiological, and biochemical approaches to study aspects of rapid hormone action in a broad array of systems across different levels of biological organization. What emerged was an overwhelming consensus that the use of integrative and comparative approaches fuels discovery and increases our understanding of de novo hormone synthesis, local actions of neurohormones, and subsequent effects on neuroplasticity and behavior.",Animals|Neurosecretory Systems|Neurotransmitter Agents|Vertebrates

Although ovarian stem cells (OSCs) of older women are capable of producing in vitro fresh oocyte-like cells (OLCs), such cells cannot respond to IVM and IVF due to the lack of granulosa cells required for their maturation. Follicular renewal is also dependent on support of circulating blood mononuclear cells. They induce intermediary stages of meiosis (metaphase I chromosomal duplication and crossover, anaphase, telophase, and cytokinesis) in newly emerging ovarian germ cells, as for the first time demonstrated here, induce formation of granulosa cells, and stimulate follicular growth and development. A pretreatment of OSC culture with mononuclear cells collected from blood of a young healthy fertile woman may cause differentiation of bipotential OSCs into both developing germ and granulosa cells. A small blood volume replacement may enable treatment of ovarian infertility in vivo. The transferred mononuclear cells may temporarily rejuvenate virtually all tissues, including improvement of the function of endocrine tissues. Formation of new follicles and their development may be sufficient for IVM and IVF. The novel proposed in vitro approaches may be used as a second possibility. Infertility of human males affects almost a half of the infertility cases worldwide. Small blood volume replacement from young healthy fertile men may also be easy approach for the improvement of sperm quality in older or other affected men. In addition, body rejuvenation by small blood volume replacement from young healthy individuals of the same sex could represent a decline of in vitro methodology in favor of in vivo treatment for human functional diseases. Here we propose for the first time that blood mononuclear cells are essential for rejuvenation of those tissues, where immune system components participate in an appropriate division and differentiation of tissue stem cells. If needed, small blood volume replacement from distinct young healthy individuals could be utilized in six month intervals for repair of young altered or aged reproductive and other tissue functions. Systemic and local use of honey bee propolis tincture is an alternative option for functional rejuvenation of some tissues.","Female|Fertilization in Vitro|Germ Cells|Humans|Infertility, Female|Infertility, Male|Male|Ovary|Primary Ovarian Insufficiency|Stem Cells|Testis"

Given constitutional protection and the cultural entrenchment of private gun ownership in the U.S., it is likely that guns will remain widely accessible--and largely unrestricted--for the foreseeable future. Therefore, most policies and laws intended to reduce firearm violence focus selectively on preventing ""dangerous people"" from having access to guns. That is a formidable challenge. How do we think productively about guns and mental illness in this context, and about the role of law in lessening the toll of gun violence?","Firearms|Humans|Mental Disorders|Psychiatry|Public Health|Risk Assessment|Societies, Medical|United States|Violence"

12881560",Sociality and health: impacts of sociality on disease susceptibility and transmission in animal and human societies.,2015-04-15,"This paper introduces a theme issue presenting the latest developments in research on the impacts of sociality on health and fitness. The articles that follow cover research on societies ranging from insects to humans. Variation in measures of fitness (i.e. survival and reproduction) has been linked to various aspects of sociality in humans and animals alike, and variability in individual health and condition has been recognized as a key mediator of these relationships. Viewed from a broad evolutionary perspective, the evolutionary transitions from a solitary lifestyle to group living have resulted in several new health-related costs and benefits of sociality. Social transmission of parasites within groups represents a major cost of group living, but some behavioural mechanisms, such as grooming, have evolved repeatedly to reduce this cost. Group living also has created novel costs in terms of altered susceptibility to infectious and non-infectious disease as a result of the unavoidable physiological consequences of social competition and integration, which are partly alleviated by social buffering in some vertebrates. Here, we define the relevant aspects of sociality, summarize their health-related costs and benefits, and discuss possible fitness measures in different study systems. Given the pervasive effects of social factors on health and fitness, we propose a synthesis of existing conceptual approaches in disease ecology, ecological immunology and behavioural neurosciences by adding sociality as a key factor, with the goal to generate a broader framework for organismal integration of health-related research.","Animals|Behavior, Animal|Biological Evolution|Communicable Diseases|Disease Susceptibility|Genetic Fitness|Humans|Models, Biological|Social Behavior"

Multiple factors played a role in this rapid expansion which led Southern Africa to become the most heavily afflicted region for HIV/AIDS globally. In this issue of Current HIV/AIDS Reports, investigators with active research interests in the region have reviewed key elements of the causes of and responses to the epidemic. Putative causes of the high HIV prevalence in the region are discussed, including host and viral biology, human behavior, politics and policy, structural factors, health services, health workforce, migration, traditional healers' role, and other issues. Regional epidemiological trends are described and forecasted. Issues related to the continuum of HIV care and treatment are highlighted. We hope that the reviews will prove useful to those policymakers, health care workers, and scientists who are striving to reduce the burden of HIV in the southern African region, as well as prove insightful for key issues of broader global relevance.","Africa, Southern|Continuity of Patient Care|HIV|HIV Infections|Humans|Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical|Prevalence|Sexually Transmitted Diseases, Viral"

21142982",Wound models for periodontal and bone regeneration: the role of biologic research.,2015-04-14,"The ultimate goals of periodontal therapy remain the complete regeneration of those periodontal tissues lost to the destructive inflammatory-immune response, or to trauma, with tissues that possess the same structure and function, and the re-establishment of a sustainable health-promoting biofilm from one characterized by dysbiosis. This volume of Periodontology 2000 discusses the multiple facets of a transition from therapeutic empiricism during the late 1960s, toward regenerative therapies, which is founded on a clearer understanding of the biophysiology of normal structure and function. This introductory article provides an overview on the requirements of appropriate in vitro laboratory models (e.g. cell culture), of preclinical (i.e. animal) models and of human studies for periodontal wound and bone repair. Laboratory studies may provide valuable fundamental insights into basic mechanisms involved in wound repair and regeneration but also suffer from a unidimensional and simplistic approach that does not account for the complexities of the in vivo situation, in which multiple cell types and interactions all contribute to definitive outcomes. Therefore, such laboratory studies require validatory research, employing preclinical models specifically designed to demonstrate proof-of-concept efficacy, preliminary safety and adaptation to human disease scenarios. Small animal models provide the most economic and logistically feasible preliminary approaches but the outcomes do not necessarily translate to larger animal or human models. The advantages and limitations of all periodontal-regeneration models need to be carefully considered when planning investigations to ensure that the optimal design is adopted to answer the specific research question posed. Future challenges lie in the areas of stem cell research, scaffold designs, cell delivery and choice of growth factors, along with research to ensure appropriate gingival coverage in order to prevent gingival recession during the healing phase.","Animals|Bone Regeneration|Disease Models, Animal|Guided Tissue Regeneration, Periodontal|Humans|Periodontal Diseases|Wound Healing"

CDC is working closely with federal partners, public health departments, and communities throughout the United States on multiple surveillance, programmatic, and research initiatives to inform and improve outcomes along the HIV care continuum. Currently, a large number of research projects are being conducted to describe the care continuum in various populations, assess and model the impact of interventions, and monitor the quality of care. To contribute to this knowledge base, NIH is working with its academic partners to support research that will inform the optimization of HIV treatment and prevention programs. As part of this focus, the CFAR/APC HIV Continuum of Care Working Group was formed to encourage communication between academic investigators and their local DOHs and to support joint research initiatives that are both timely and relevant to their own cities and environments. Finally, the results presented in this supplement may have implications for jurisdictions beyond those in which the studies were conducted.","Biomedical Research|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S.|Cities|Continuity of Patient Care|HIV Infections|Health Planning|Humans|National Health Programs|National Institutes of Health (U.S.)|Prevalence|Public Health|United States"

25252687",Plant salt tolerance: adaptations in halophytes.,2015-04-07,"Most of the water on Earth is seawater, each kilogram of which contains about 35 g of salts, and yet most plants cannot grow in this solution; less than 0·2% of species can develop and reproduce with repeated exposure to seawater. These 'extremophiles' are called halophytes.
Improved knowledge of halophytes is of importance to understanding our natural world and to enable the use of some of these fascinating plants in land re-vegetation, as forages for livestock, and to develop salt-tolerant crops. In this Preface to a Special Issue on halophytes and saline adaptations, the evolution of salt tolerance in halophytes, their life-history traits and progress in understanding the molecular, biochemical and physiological mechanisms contributing to salt tolerance are summarized. In particular, cellular processes that underpin the ability of halophytes to tolerate high tissue concentrations of Na+ and Cl−, including regulation of membrane transport, their ability to synthesize compatible solutes and to deal with reactive oxygen species, are highlighted. Interacting stress factors in addition to salinity, such as heavy metals and flooding, are also topics gaining increased attention in the search to understand the biology of halophytes.
Halophytes will play increasingly important roles as models for understanding plant salt tolerance, as genetic resources contributing towards the goal of improvement of salt tolerance in some crops, for re-vegetation of saline lands, and as 'niche crops' in their own right for landscapes with saline soils.","Adaptation, Physiological|Conservation of Natural Resources|Crops, Agricultural|Floods|Ion Transport|Metals, Heavy|Salt Tolerance|Salt-Tolerant Plants|Sodium Chloride|Stress, Physiological"

23613888",Pediatric obesity. An introduction.,2015-04-04,"The prevalence of child and adolescent obesity in the United States increased dramatically between 1970 and 2000, and there are few indications that the rates of childhood obesity are decreasing. Obesity is associated with myriad medical, psychological, and neurocognitive abnormalities that impact children's health and quality of life. Genotypic variation is important in determining the susceptibility of individual children to undue gains in adiposity; however, the rapid increase in pediatric obesity prevalence suggests that changes to children's environments and/or to their learned behaviors may dramatically affect body weight regulation. This paper presents an overview of the epidemiology, consequences, and etiopathogenesis of pediatric obesity, serving as a general introduction to the subsequent papers in this Special Issue that address aspects of childhood obesity and cognition in detail.",Adolescent|Body Weight|Child|Comorbidity|Humans|Pediatric Obesity|Prevalence|Risk Factors|United States

The papers in this special issue represent important contributions to defining a more general model of ABTs for adolescents. Our discussion of these papers is organized by a series of challenges to developing and evaluating these treatments. We first consider how disturbances in the caregiver-adolescent attachment bond are implicated in adolescent psychopathology and family distress. We then describe different potential targets for attachment-based interventions for adolescents and their caregivers. Finally we review the different interventions and change mechanisms that have been used to increase security in the caregiver-adolescent bond. A general model of ABTs for adolescents can be useful in guiding future efforts to measure change in attachment constructs, evaluate the dynamic process of change in attachment bonds, and test the effectiveness of specific treatment elements in reducing adolescents' symptoms and increasing attachment security.","Adolescent|Caregivers|Humans|Models, Psychological|Object Attachment|Psychology, Adolescent"

25821089,"Generalized joint hypermobility, joint hypermobility syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, hypermobility type.",2015-03-31,"This issue of the American Journal of Medical Genetics Seminar Series Part C is dedicated to generalized joint hypermobility (gJHM), joint hypermobility syndrome (JHS), and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, hypermobility type (EDS-HT). gJHM is the best known clinical manifestation of inherited defects of the connective tissue. On the other side, JHS and EDS-HT are actually considered one and the same from a clinical perspective by most practitioners and researchers (i.e., JHS/EDS-HT), and their molecular basis remains unknown. For decades, ""non-syndromic"" gJHM and JHS/EDS-HT have been thought to be simple clinical curiosities or an asset for the ""affected"" individual. In recent years, the attention on these partially overlapping phenotypes has increased, as they are now recognized risk factors for a series of non-communicable diseases and long-term disabilities. This series consists of 10 papers focused on three main topics, namely (i) assessment and differential diagnosis of children and adults with gJHM, (ii) systematic presentation of selected key non-articular manifestations of JHS/EDS-HT and actual perception of physiotherapy as the best therapeutic resource for this condition, and (iii) exploration of the available knowledge relating ""congenital laxity of tissues"" to various dysfunctions of the nervous system during development and adulthood. The contributors hope that this collection raises attention to this fascinating field of knowledge, which seems to have ramifications in virtually all medical disciplines.","Adult|Child|Diagnosis, Differential|Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome|Humans|Joint Instability|Phenotype|Risk Factors|Surveys and Questionnaires"

25172178",Unmet challenges in immune-mediated hepatobiliary diseases.,2015-03-31,"It is ironic that the liver, which serves a critical function in immune tolerance, itself becomes the victim of an autoimmune attack. Indeed, liver autoimmunity and the autoimmune diseases associated with both innate and adaptive responses to hepatocytes and/or cholangiocytes are models of human autoimmunity. For example, in primary biliary cirrhosis, there exists a well-defined and characteristic autoantibody and considerable homogeneity between patients. In autoimmune hepatitis, there are clinical characteristics that allow a rigorous subset definition and well-defined inflammatory infiltrates. In both cases, there are defects in a variety of immune pathways and including regulatory cells. In primary sclerosing cholangitis, with its characteristic overlap with inflammatory bowel disease, there are unique defects in innate immunity and particular important contribution of lymphoid homing to disease pathogenesis. In these diseases, as with other human autoimmune processes, there is the critical understanding that pathogenesis requires a genetic background, but is determined by environmental features, and indeed the concordance of these diseases in identical twins highlights the stochastic nature of immunopathology. Unfortunately, despite major advances in basic immunology and in immunopathology in these diseases, there remains a major void in therapy. The newer biologics that are so widely used in rheumatology, neurology, and gastroenterology have not yet seen success in autoimmune liver disease. Future efforts will depend on more rigorous molecular biology and systems analysis in order for successful application to be made to patients.",Autoimmune Diseases|Biliary Tract Diseases|Humans|Liver Diseases

25832121",Editorial: emerging issues in sociotechnical systems thinking and workplace safety.,2015-03-31,"The burden of on-the-job accidents and fatalities and the harm of associated human suffering continue to present an important challenge for safety researchers and practitioners. While significant improvements have been achieved in recent decades, the workplace accident rate remains unacceptably high. This has spurred interest in the development of novel research approaches, with particular interest in the systemic influences of social/organisational and technological factors. In response, the Hopkinton Conference on Sociotechnical Systems and Safety was organised to assess the current state of knowledge in the area and to identify research priorities. Over the course of several months prior to the conference, leading international experts drafted collaborative, state-of-the-art reviews covering various aspects of sociotechnical systems and safety. These papers, presented in this special issue, cover topics ranging from the identification of key concepts and definitions to sociotechnical characteristics of safe and unsafe organisations. This paper provides an overview of the conference and introduces key themes and topics.
Sociotechnical approaches to workplace safety are intended to draw practitioners' attention to the critical influence that systemic social/organisational and technological factors exert on safety-relevant outcomes. This paper introduces major themes addressed in the Hopkinton Conference within the context of current workplace safety research and practice challenges.","Accidents, Occupational|Congresses as Topic|Humans|Occupational Health|Research|Safety|Systems Analysis"

Since that time, continuing advances have been made to address the threat of fire-in workplace fire safety practices and regulations, in training and safety requirements for firefighters and first responders, and in hazard communication laws that enhance disaster planning and response. Recent high profile events, including the West, Texas fertilizer plant explosion, derailments of fuel cargo trains, and garment factory fires in Bangladesh, have brought renewed attention to fire as a workplace health and safety issue and to the unevenness of safety standards and regulatory enforcement, in the United States as well as internationally. In this article, we provide an overview of fire as a workplace health and safety hazard and an introduction to the essays included in this special issue of New Solutions on fire and work.","Accidents, Occupational|Fires|Humans|Occupational Diseases|Occupational Exposure|Occupational Health|Planning Techniques|Safety Management|United States|Workplace"

25256555",It takes two: noninvasive brain stimulation combined with neurorehabilitation.,2015-03-31,"The goal of postacute neurorehabilitation is to maximize patient function, ideally by using surviving brain and central nervous system tissue when possible. However, the structures incorporated into neurorehabilitative approaches often differ from this target, which may explain why the efficacy of conventional clinical treatments targeting neurologic impairment varies widely. Noninvasive brain stimulation (eg, transcranial magnetic stimulation [TMS], transcranial direct current stimulation [tDCS]) offers the possibility of directly targeting brain structures to facilitate or inhibit their activity to steer neural plasticity in recovery and measure neuronal output and interactions for evaluating progress. The latest advances as stereotactic navigation and electric field modeling are enabling more precise targeting of patient's residual structures in diagnosis and therapy. Given its promise, this supplement illustrates the wide-ranging significance of TMS and tDCS in neurorehabilitation, including in stroke, pediatrics, traumatic brain injury, focal hand dystonia, neuropathic pain, and spinal cord injury. TMS and tDCS are still not widely used and remain poorly understood in neurorehabilitation. Therefore, the present supplement includes articles that highlight ready clinical application of these technologies, including their comparative diagnostic capabilities relative to neuroimaging, their therapeutic benefit, their optimal delivery, the stratification of likely responders, and the variable benefits associated with their clinical use because of interactions between pathophysiology and the innate reorganization of the patient's brain. Overall, the supplement concludes that whether provided in isolation or in combination, noninvasive brain stimulation and neurorehabilitation are synergistic in the potential to transform clinical practice.",Brain Diseases|Humans|Neuroimaging|Physical Therapy Modalities|Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation|Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation

Furthermore, the construct implies a theoretical model that has considerable utility as an organizing framework for the study of schizophrenia, schizophrenia-related psychopathology (eg, delusional disorder, psychosis-NOS (not otherwise specified), schizotypal, and paranoid personality disorder), and putative schizophrenia endophenotypes as suggested by Rado, Meehl, Gottesman, Lenzenweger, and others. The understanding (and misunderstanding) of the schizophrenia-related schizotypy model, particularly as regards clinical illness, as well as an alternative approach to the construct require vigilance in order to ensure the methodological approach continues to yield the fruit that it can in illuminating the pathogenesis of schizophrenia-related psychopathology.

What kind of knowledge has schizotypy research provided in furthering our understanding of schizophrenia? What types of questions can schizotypy research tackle, and which are the conceptual and methodological frameworks to address them? How will schizotypy research contribute to future scientific endeavors? The International Lemanic Workshop brought together leading experts in the field around the tasks of articulating the essential findings in schizotypy research, as well as providing some key insights and guidance to face scientific challenges of the future.

Advocates of EBP seek to standardize clinical practice by ensuring that only treatment techniques that have demonstrated therapeutic outcomes under scientifically controlled conditions would be adopted and promoted in mental health services. Advocates of CC seek to diversify clinical practice by ensuring that treatment approaches are designed and refined for a multicultural clientele that reflects a wide variety of psychological orientations and life experiences. As these two powerful mandates collide, the fundamental challenge becomes how to accommodate substantive cultural divergences in psychosocial experience using narrowly prescriptive clinical practices and approaches, without trivializing either professional knowledge or cultural difference. In this Introduction to a special issue of Transcultural Psychiatry, the virtue of an interdisciplinary conversation between and among anthropologists, psychologists, psychiatrists, and social work researchers in addressing these tensions is extolled.",Cultural Competency|Ethnopsychology|Evidence-Based Practice|Humans|Interdisciplinary Communication|Mental Health Services

Global research focus has been aimed mainly toward this direction. In this thematic issue, updated information has been collected regarding the structure, function and signaling of WWOX, along with its critical role as a tumor suppressor and participation in metabolism, neurodegeneration, ataxia, epilepsy, neural disorders, neuronal damages, and interactions with oncogenic viruses. WWOX is not a driver of cancer initiation. Chromosomal alterations in the WWOX gene enhance cancer progression. Importantly, a homozygous nonsense mutation of WWOX gene in humans leads to neural pathologies and early death, rather than spontaneous cancer development. These findings suggest new physiological functions of WWOX in metabolism and neural diseases, and these areas require further investigation.",Humans|Mutation|Neoplasms|Nervous System Diseases|Oxidoreductases|Signal Transduction|Tumor Suppressor Proteins|WW Domain-Containing Oxidoreductase

25799919,"60 years of advances in neuropsychopharmacology for improving brain health, renewed hope for progress.",2015-03-25,"Pharmacotherapy is effective in helping many patients suffering from psychiatric and neurological disorders, and both psychotherapeutic and stimulation-based techniques likewise have important roles to play in their treatment. However, therapeutic progress has recently been slow. Future success for improving the control and prevention of brain disorders will depend upon deeper insights into their causes and pathophysiological substrates. It will also necessitate new and more rigorous methods for identifying, validating, developing and clinically deploying new treatments. A field of Research and Development (R and D) that remains critical to this endeavour is Neuropsychopharmacology which transformed the lives of patients by introducing pharmacological treatments for psychiatric disorder some 60 years ago. For about half of this time, the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology (ECNP) has fostered efforts to enhance our understanding of the brain, and to improve the management of psychiatric disorders. Further, together with partners in academia and industry, and in discussions with regulators and patients, the ECNP is implicated in new initiatives to achieve this goal. This is then an opportune moment to survey the field, to analyse what we have learned from the achievements and failures of the past, and to identify major challenges for the future. It is also important to highlight strategies that are being put in place in the quest for more effective treatment of brain disorders: from experimental research and drug discovery to clinical development and collaborative ventures for reinforcing ""R and D"". The present article sets the scene, then introduces and interlinks the eight articles that comprise this Special Volume of European Neuropsychopharmacology. A broad-based suite of themes is covered embracing: the past, present and future of ""R and D"" for psychiatric disorders; complementary contributions of genetics and epigenetics; efforts to improve the treatment of depression, neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders; and advances in the analysis and neuroimaging of cellular and cerebral circuits.","Animals|Brain|Brain Diseases|Central Nervous System Agents|Epigenesis, Genetic|Humans|Mental Disorders|Models, Neurological"

Among soft-bodied invertebrates, jaws are known from annelids, chaetognaths, flatworms, gnathostomulids, micrognathozoans, mollusks, rotifers, and several ecdysozoans. Depending on the taxon, jaws may function in the capture of prey (e.g., chaetognaths and flatworms), processing of prey (e.g., gnathostomulids and onychophorans), or both (e.g., rotifers). Although structural diversity among invertebrates’ jaws is becoming better characterized with the use of electron microscopy, many details remain poorly described, including neuromuscular control, elemental composition, and physical characteristics, such as hardness and resistance to wear. Unfortunately, absence of relevant data has impeded understanding of their functional diversity and evolutionary origins. With this symposium, we bring together researchers of disparately jawed taxa to draw structural and mechanistic comparisons among species to determine their commonalities. Additionally, we show that rotifers’ jaws, which are perhaps the best-characterized jaws among invertebrates, are still enigmatic with regard to their origins and mechanics. Nevertheless, technologies such as energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and 3D modeling are being used to characterize their chemical composition and to develop physical models that allow exploration of their mechanical properties, respectively. We predict that these methods can also be used to develop biomimetic and bioinspired constructs based on the full range of the complexity of jaws, and that such constructs also can be developed from other invertebrate taxa. These approaches may also shed light on common developmental and physiological processes that facilitate the evolution of invertebrates’ jaws.",Animals|Biological Evolution|Jaw|Rotifera
25790841,"Editorial: subjective perceptions of memory functioning in old age - nature, correlates, and developmental trajectories.",2015-03-21,"Subjective memory complaints are often used as diagnostic criteria for several neurocognitive disorders. Although a number of studies have examined subjective memory and its associations with memory functioning in adulthood and old age, it is still an open question whether subjective perceptions of one's memory indicate actual memory functioning or whether they are rather derived from factors other than memory, such as depressive symptoms. The studies in this special section examine subjective perceptions of memory functioning and their associations with objectively measured memory performance in general and in clinical populations. The four articles adopt cross-sectional and longitudinal methodologies and offer key insights into the nature, correlates, and developmental trajectories of subjective memory. To begin with, the studies compiled in this special section demonstrate that changes in subjective memory perceptions are indeed associated with changes in memory performance [Zimprich and Kurtz, this issue, pp. 223-231], but the size of associations between levels of and changes in subjective memory and memory performance is in part modulated by personality characteristics and depressive symptoms [Hülür et al., this issue, pp. 232-240]. Second, the studies compiled here show that factors other than memory are also closely associated with memory perceptions, including functional health as well as domain-general and health-specific control beliefs [Luszcz et al., this issue, pp. 241-250]. Third, the study by Thompson et al. [this issue, pp. 251-257] shows that self- and informant-reports of retrospective and prospective memory difficulties are not associated with performance-based measures and does not sufficiently differentiate between healthy controls and patients diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment or dementia. In our editorial, we put these findings in perspective and discuss implications for research and practice. To extend our knowledge, we conclude by outlining two key avenues for future research: (i) longitudinal multivariate studies of the construct space surrounding subjective memory and (ii) the viability of experience sampling studies with daily or hourly measurements to tackle some of the mechanisms underlying these associations.",Aged|Aging|Diagnostic Self Evaluation|Female|Geriatrics|Humans|Male|Memory|Memory Disorders|Perception

On this basis, we express reservation about the conclusions offered by the APA Task Force. This special issue explores whether there are other therapeutic relationship elements that warrant consideration and further study. We were particularly interested in those elements that showed promise based on empirical or theoretical grounds, and in each article, we asked for an account of how the case formulation would guide the methods of adaptation for each individual client, and how the element would contribute to clinically relevant changes.","Evidence-Based Practice|Humans|Meta-Analysis as Topic|Professional-Patient Relations|Psychotherapy|Societies, Scientific"

25099360",Editorial: The shape of the nosology to come in developmental psychopathology.,2015-03-17,"The field has embarked on an effort to better integrate neurobiological and psychological dimensions of functioning with putative psychopathological syndromes. If successful, this effort aims to be a turning point as impactful as the change, a century ago, away from the study of symptom dimensions and toward the study of psychopathological syndromes. New statistical and neurobiological methods and findings hold considerable promise in this regard, and several papers in the present issue underscore these ongoing and important new directions. For this proposed direction to succeed, however, three guiding principles are necessary. First, the syndromal approach must continue to be viewed as provisional, and not reified. Second, in contrast, individual dimensions of neurobiology, psychology, personality, or symptoms should not be decontextualized but considered in relation to other traits and dimensions, syndromal configurations. Major clinical syndromes cannot be ignored. Third, following the Kraepelian insights of a century ago in addition to the more recent insights of developmental psychopathlogy, trait and dimension aspects of psychopathology need to be understood in their developmental context. Whether an integrated dimensional-categorical-developmental understanding of psychopathology can be extended to the entire nosology or only parts of it remains to be seen.",Humans|Mental Disorders|Neurobiology|Psychopathology
25771022,Reflections on HIS 2014: In praise of enthusiasts.,2015-03-17,"Medical conferences have had a bad press recently. They have been accused of leaving nothing but indifferent research and an enormous carbon footprint. They are also likely to contribute to 'intervention bias' in healthcare, in that the speakers tend to be selected from among the more enthusiastic interventionists and charismatic optimists. But this weakness is arguably also an important strength, for they can be the vehicle by which participants are inspired to innovate and evaluate. It is difficult to predict the outcome of interventions aimed at prevention and control of infection because they involve interactions between people and complex systems, not to mention the invisible agents of infection. Progress therefore depends largely on the empirical approach - trial and error. In this context we need both enthusiasts to inspire trial and sceptics to expose error. Conferences deserve support for encouraging debate between enthusiasts and sceptics, for providing a forum for cross-fertilization between sub-specialties, and for inspiring trainees as well as practitioners. The papers presented in this issue of JHI illustrate the wide range of contemporary challenges in healthcare-associated infection, and summarize the 'state of the art' of infection prevention and control.","Cross Infection|Disease Transmission, Infectious|Health Facilities|Humans|Infection Control"

This development, we would argue, is much stimulated by the sociology of childhood which has drawn our attention to how children as a social group are placed and perceived within the structure of society, and within inter-generational relations, as well as how children are social agents and co-constructors of their social world. Drawing on this tradition, we here address some cross-cutting themes that we think are important to further the study of child health: situating children within health policy, drawing attention to practices around children's health and well-being and a focus on children as health actors. The paper contributes to a critical analysis of child health policy and notions of child health and normality, pointing to theoretical and empirical research potential for the sociology of children's health and illness.",Child|Child Health|Child Welfare|Humans|Sociology

The co-editors provide broad reference points for the focus on clinical concerns, levels of treatment, variations in types of perpetrators, screening for groups, and the group-as-a-whole, relational, and social contexts of violence. Whether in small therapy groups, social interventions, or society's management of violence, empathy, boundaries, holding, and containment must be provided in such a way that they prevent violent acts while healing the hurts and shame that underlie violence in all its forms.

25760316,Self-injury and suicidality: the impact of trauma and dissociation.,2015-03-12,"In the growing research literature on nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) and suicidality (SA), there are many questions still unresolved about the role played by exposure to traumatic stressors (including but not limited to childhood maltreatment) and posttraumatic disorders (including dissociative features and disorders). In this special issue of the Journal of Trauma & Dissociation, a review article and 4 empirical studies attempt to provide additional insight into the relationship of traumatization and dissociation to NSSI and SA. The review article describes similarities and differences in the relationships that have been empirically documented between trauma exposure and posttraumatic stress or dissociative symptoms with NSSI versus SA and highlights the need for research to identify and test integrative clinical constructs, such as emotion dysregulation, in order to develop systematic risk, assessment, and intervention models. The empirical reports provide illustrative examples of conceptually and clinically integrated research on traumatic stress, dissociation, and NSSI and SA. Their findings offer a more nuanced picture of the potential role of different forms and degrees of dissociation in SA and NSSI and suggest that dissociation and emotion dysregulation may play a mediating role linking childhood maltreatment and adult or adolescent NSSI. In this introduction, we briefly summarize key points from the special issue articles and point out directions that their findings suggest for future research, including incorporating multiple predictors in studies of NSSI and SA, utilizing longitudinal studies to assess the etiology and course of NSSI and SA, and sampling diverse populations.","Dissociative Disorders|Humans|Risk Factors|Self-Injurious Behavior|Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic|Suicide"

25749373,Neurodegenerative diseases in the era of targeted therapeutics: how to handle a tangled issue.,2015-03-10,"Neurodegenerative diseases are age-related and relentlessly progressive with increasing prevalence and no cure or lasting symptomatic therapy. The well-recognized prodromal phase in many forms of neurodegeneration suggests a prolonged period of neuronal compensated dysfunction prior to cell loss that may be amenable to therapeutic intervention. Although most efforts to date have been focused on misfolded toxic proteins, it is now clear that widespread changes in protein homeostasis occur early in these diseases and understanding this fundamental biology is key to the design of targeted therapies. What has emerged from molecular genetics and animal studies is a previously less appreciated association of neurodegenerative diseases with defects in the molecular regulation of protein trafficking between cellular organelles, especially the intricate network of endosomes, lysosomes, autophagosomes and mitochondria. Here we summarized the broader concepts that stemmed from this Special Issue on ""Protein Clearance in Neurodegenerative diseases: from mechanisms to therapies"".

Until fairly recently, such modifications were considered ""damage"" as a result of oxidative stress, before researchers recognized their physiological importance for biologic signaling. This paradigm shift, and the associated necessity to accurately characterize and quantify the various pathways of thiol redox modifications not only for specific proteins, but also within the cellular environment, has enticed researchers to take a close look at the impact of environment and molecular (protein) structure on these reactions. This Special Issue on Redox Biology of Thiols in Signaling Pathways is the result of a workshop organized at the 2013 Annual Meeting of the Society for Free Radical Biology and Medicine in San Antonio, Texas, summarizing the contributions from many of the presenters. It will provide a stimulating synopsis on what is known, and what is not known, about the reaction mechanisms which underlie the role of thiols and oxidative processes in signaling pathways.",Animals|Biocatalysis|Cysteine|Disulfides|Electrons|Free Radicals|Glutathione|Humans|Kinetics|Oxidation-Reduction|Oxidoreductases|Signal Transduction|Sulfhydryl Compounds|Thermodynamics

The passage of state regulations specific to hen housing created urgency to better understand the effects of different housing systems on the sustainability of the egg supply, and stimulated the formation of a coalition, the Coalition for a Sustainable Egg Supply (CSES), to conduct research on this topic. The CSES is a multi-stakeholder group with 27 members, including food manufacturers, research institutions, scientists, restaurants, food service, retail food companies, egg suppliers, and nongovernmental organizations. A commercial-scale study was developed to better understand the effect of 3 housing systems (conventional cage, enriched colony, and cage-free aviary) on 5 areas related to a sustainable egg supply. These 5 sustainability areas represent effects on people, animals, and the environment: animal health and well-being, environment, food safety, worker health and safety, and food affordability. Five teams of scientists, each associated with a sustainability area, conducted an integrated field study at a commercial site in the upper Midwest through 2 flock cycles in 3 housing systems. This paper provides a brief overview of the CSES project to serve as an introduction for the papers that follow in this volume of Poultry Science.","Animal Husbandry|Animal Welfare|Animals|Eggs|Environment|Food|Food Safety|Housing, Animal|Humans|Midwestern United States|Occupational Health|Poultry|Social Responsibility"

Off-label drug use is ubiquitous in reproductive medicine, a fact that may be related to the disincentives to formally study these drugs in a potentially vulnerable population (i.e., pregnant women). It behooves clinicians to discuss with patients the risk-benefit ratio of treatment, and whether a treatment is FDA-approved for that condition. Researchers, seeking better data on effects of these drugs, may find fodder for future clinical studies in these articles.",Biomedical Research|Drug Approval|Drug Labeling|Drug Utilization|Female|Humans|Off-Label Use|Pregnancy|Prescription Drug Misuse|Reproductive Medicine|United States|United States Food and Drug Administration

This Classic Text deals with Section VI of his Observations on Man …, namely, the 'Imperfections of the rational Faculty'. Hartley defines madness as an imperfection of reason that can be temporary or enduring. He makes use of his model of mental functioning to differentiate between eight clinical categories of madness, each representing a different pattern of vibrations of the nerves. Hartley developed this model based on Newton's theory of vibrations and, to explain the complexity of mental acts and entities, he combined it with his own version of the mechanism of Association of Ideas borrowed from John Locke.

This emerging literature, however, is sparse compared with studies on the assessment of risk for violent and offending behavior. In this special issue of Behavioral Sciences and the Law, we have gathered together empirical and review papers exemplifying promising directions and methodologies. We begin with a review of the state of the field, and lessons that can be drawn from research into medical risk assessment and risk communication, finding that many of the same principles apply to the forensic context. How risks are framed, and how numerate assessors are, affects how risk information is understood and applied. We discuss the existing research bearing on these issues, as well as the conceptual, practical, empirical, and legal implications of communicating risk using numerical or categorical risk terms. Along with the seven articles in this volume, we suggest directions for future research on measuring and communicating change, understanding and managing the statistical literacy of those who use and communicate risk assessments, and developing a theoretical framework for forensic risk communication research. We hope this volume will help integrate and invigorate research into forensic risk communication.",Communication|Crime|Humans|Recurrence|Risk|Violence

Peri-implantitis is an emerging public health issue. Such a high burden of disease and its social, oral and systemic consequences are compelling reasons for increased attention towards prevention for individuals, professionals and public health officials.
Sixteen systematic reviews and meta-reviews formed the basis for workshop discussions. Deliberations resulted in four consensus reports.
This workshop calls for renewed emphasis on the prevention of periodontitis and peri-implantitis. A critical element is the recognition that prevention needs to be tailored to the individual's needs through diagnosis and risk profiling. Discussions identified critical aspects that may help in the large-scale implementation of preventive programs: (i) a need to communicate to the public the critical importance of gingival bleeding as an early sign of disease, (ii) the need for universal implementation of periodontal screening by the oral health care team, (iii) the role of the oral health team in health promotion and primary and secondary prevention, (iv) understanding the limitations of self-medication with oral health care products without a diagnosis of the underlying condition, and (v) access to appropriate and effective professional preventive care.
The workshop provided specific recommendations for individuals, the oral health team and public health officials.

An advantage of the GnRH agonist trigger is the ability to retrieve oocytes in high responders, yet markedly reducing the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). However, the induction of early luteolysis after the GnRH agonist trigger requires the use of aggressive steroidal luteal support or low-dose hCG to allow successful fresh ET and live birth. With the enhanced effectiveness of vitrification, segmentation in GnRH agonist-triggered cycles with freezing all embryos for transfer in subsequent cycles may be the optimal strategy for eliminating OHSS.","Female|Fertility Agents, Female|Fertilization in Vitro|Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone|Humans|Ovarian Follicle|Ovulation Induction|Pregnancy|Pregnancy Rate"

18370618",What can we learn from the study of Mexican-origin families in the United States?,2015-02-14,"Mexican-origin families are a large and rapidly increasing subgroup of the U.S. population, but they remain underrepresented in family scholarship. This paper introduces a special section of four papers on Mexican-origin families designed to contribute to the advancement of research on how cultural, family, and gender socialization processes unfold across key developmental periods and life transitions in this cultural context. Two longitudinal studies of Mexican-origin families provided the data for these four papers: (a) The Juntos Project, an 8-year longitudinal study of mothers, fathers, and adolescent sibling pairs in 246 Mexican-origin families; and (b) The Supporting MAMI Project, a study following 204 adolescent mothers and their mother figures from the third trimester of pregnancy through their young children's 5th birthdays. In this introductory paper, we highlight four themes, including (a) differential acculturation and reciprocal socialization, (b) interdependence in families, (c) the intersection of culture and gender, and (d) methodological issues. We end with suggestions for future research.",Acculturation|Adolescent|Adult|Female|Humans|Longitudinal Studies|Male|Mexican Americans|Mexico|Nuclear Family|Parenting|Pregnancy|Sex Factors|Social Values|Socialization|United States|Young Adult

Affecting approximately 3% of the population, OCD, with its damaging effect on psychosocial function, is among the most severe and impairing of mental disorders. In Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 (DSM-5), OCD and related disorders form a separate classification, consistent with convergent research that indicates OCD is distinct from anxiety disorders in psychopathology and treatment requirements. Although evidence-based treatments have been developed for OCD, these are not accessible to many sufferers. Timely evidence-based treatment is recommended to avoid unnecessary progression to chronicity, disability, and intransigence of symptoms. Improvement in existing training models is needed to disseminate advanced specialty clinical skills to optimize illness recovery. This special series by The Canadian Institute for Obsessive Compulsive Disorders (CIOCD) Accreditation Task Force (ATF) critically reviews evidence-based psychological and pharmacological treatments for OCD throughout the lifespan. The ATF mandate is to establish specialty OCD certification/accreditation standards and competencies. This pioneering initiative aims to achieve transformational change in accessibility to evidence-based clinical care so urgently needed for young people and adults suffering from OCD.",Adult|Canada|Humans|Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder

25641218,Introduction: contexts and concepts of adaptability and plasticity in 20th-century plant science.,2015-02-03,"Nowhere is the problem of understanding the complex linkages between organisms and their environments more apparent than in the science of plants. Today, efforts by scientists to predict and manage the biological consequences of shifting global and regional climates depend on understanding how organisms respond morphologically, physiologically, and behaviorally to changes in their environments. Investigating organismal ""adaptability"" (or ""plasticity"") is rarely straightforward, prompting controversy and discourse among and between ecologists and agricultural scientists. Concepts like agro-climatic adaptation, phenotypic plasticity, and genotype-environment interaction (GxE) are key to those debates, and their complex histories have imbued them with assumptions and meanings that are consequential but often opaque. This special section explores the diverse ways in which organismal adaptability has been conceptualized and investigated in the second half of the 20th century, and the multifarious political, economic, environmental, and intellectual contexts in which those conceptions have emerged and evolved. The papers in this section bring together perspectives from the histories of agriculture, population ecology, evolutionary theory, and plant physiology, cutting across Asian, North American, and British contexts. As a whole, this section highlights not only the diversity of meanings of ""adaptability"" and ""plasticity,"" but also the complex linkages between those meanings, the scientific practices and technologies in which they are embedded, and the ends toward which those practices and technologies are employed.","Adaptation, Biological|Biological Evolution|Botany|History, 20th Century|Phenotype|Plants"

There are 13 articles that discuss a range of physical and mental health concerns among both military personnel who are currently serving and those who served in the past. The corresponding research provides insight into issues that are directly relevant and of keen interest to clinicians and investigators. The articles illustrate some of the obstacles to conducting rigorous epidemiologic research when seeking to inform the health issues of those who serve in the military and of veterans. Within the United States, they point to opportunities for the Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to address existing gaps in knowledge. The VA in particular can take advantage of its research infrastructure, altruistic veteran population, and clinical and administrative databases. In the era of multinational military interventions, international counterparts of the Department of Defense and VA should collaborate in the collection of data on relevant military exposures and also in the characterization of short- and long-term health effects related to service to better inform health needs. The work included in this issue is a call to the global research community to continue to invest resources to better characterize military service and its impact on health. Finally, these articles serve as a testament to the additional health burden carried by many of the women and men who have provided service to their country.",Epidemiologic Research Design|Female|Health Status|Humans|Male|Mental Health|Military Personnel|United States|United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Health
25609752,Epidemiology of bicycle injuries and risk factors for serious injury. 1997.,2015-01-23,"To determine the risk factors for serious injury to bicyclists, aside from helmet use.
Prospective case-control study.
Seven Seattle area hospital emergency departments and two county medical examiner's offices.
Individuals treated in the emergency department or dying from bicycle related injuries.
Information collected from injured bicyclists or their parents by questionnaire on circumstances of the crash; abstract of medical records for injury data. Serious injury defined as an injury severity score>8.
Odd ratios computed using the maximum likelihood method, and adjusted using unconditional logistic regression.
There were 3854 injured cyclists in the three year period; 3390 (88%) completed questionnaires were returned. 51% wore helmets at the time of crash. Only 22.3% of patients had head injuries and 34% had facial injuries. Risk of serious injury was increased by collision with a motor vehicle (odds ratio (OR)=4.6), self reported speed >15 mph (OR=1.2), young age (<6 years), and age >39 years (OR=2.1 and 2.2 respectively, compared with adults 20-39 years). Risk for serious injury was not affected by helmet use (OR=0.9). Risk of neck injury was increased in those struck by motor vehicles (OR=4.0), hospitalized for any injury (OR=2.0), and those who died (OR=15.1), but neck injury was not affected by helmet use.
Prevention of serious bicycle injuries cannot be accomplished through helmet use alone, and may require separation of cyclists from motor vehicles, and delaying cycling until children are developmentally ready.","Accidents, Traffic|Bicycling|Case-Control Studies|Craniocerebral Trauma|Female|Head Protective Devices|History, 20th Century|Humans|Injury Severity Score|Likelihood Functions|Male|Odds Ratio|Prospective Studies|Risk Factors|Surveys and Questionnaires|United States"

25605737",Thematic minireview series: cell biology of G protein signaling.,2015-01-22,"This thematic series is on the topic of cell signaling from a cell biology perspective, with a particular focus on G proteins. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs, also known as seven-transmembrane receptors) are typically found at the cell surface. Upon agonist binding, these receptors will activate a GTP-binding G protein at the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane. Additionally, there is growing evidence that G proteins can also be activated by non-receptor binding partners, and they can signal from non-plasma membrane compartments. The production of second messengers at multiple, spatially distinct locations represents a type of signal encoding that has been largely neglected. The first minireview in the series describes biosensors that are being used to monitor G protein signaling events in live cells. The second describes the implementation of antibody-based biosensors to dissect endosome signaling by G proteins and their receptors. The third describes the function of a non-receptor, cytoplasmic activator of G protein signaling, called GIV (Girdin). Collectively, the advances described in these articles provide a deeper understanding and emerging opportunities for new pharmacology.","Biosensing Techniques|Endosomes|GTP-Binding Proteins|Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors|Humans|Protein Binding|Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled|Signal Transduction"

Companion diagnostics takes up a central role in the development of targeted drugs and to a large extent, the success of this type of therapy depends on their performance. Companion diagnostic assays have a single patient as a point of reference and they will be decisive for the move toward a more precise and individualized pharmacotherapy. The 'first generation' of companion diagnostic assays relies on single biomarker detection but with our increasing understanding of disease pathophysiology a new generation of assays is under development, which will be based on patient profiling and multiplex platforms.","Arthritis, Rheumatoid|Humans|Molecular Diagnostic Techniques|Molecular Targeted Therapy|Neoplasms|Precision Medicine|Sequence Analysis, DNA"

Recent studies demonstrate the value of scoring high-dimensional microbiome, immune, and metabolic traits from individuals to inform personalized medicine. Efforts to integrate multiple dimensions of clinical and molecular data towards predictive multi-scale models of individual health and wellness are already underway. Improved methods for mining and discovery of clinical phenotypes from electronic medical records and technological developments in wearable sensor technologies present new opportunities for mapping and exploring the critical yet poorly characterized ""phenome"" and ""envirome"" dimensions of personalized medicine. There are ambitious new projects underway to collect multi-scale molecular, sensor, clinical, behavioral, and environmental data streams from large population cohorts longitudinally to enable more comprehensive and dynamic models of individual biology and personalized health. Personalized medicine stands to benefit from inclusion of rich new sources and dimensions of data. However, realizing these improvements in care relies upon novel informatics methodologies, tools, and systems to make full use of these data to advance both the science and translational applications of personalized medicine.",Computational Biology|Genotype|Humans|Patient-Specific Modeling|Phenotype|Precision Medicine|Systems Biology

25565249,The influence of the visual modality on language structure and conventionalization: insights from sign language and gesture.,2015-01-08,"For humans, the ability to communicate and use language is instantiated not only in the vocal modality but also in the visual modality. The main examples of this are sign languages and (co-speech) gestures. Sign languages, the natural languages of Deaf communities, use systematic and conventionalized movements of the hands, face, and body for linguistic expression. Co-speech gestures, though non-linguistic, are produced in tight semantic and temporal integration with speech and constitute an integral part of language together with speech. The articles in this issue explore and document how gestures and sign languages are similar or different and how communicative expression in the visual modality can change from being gestural to grammatical in nature through processes of conventionalization. As such, this issue contributes to our understanding of how the visual modality shapes language and the emergence of linguistic structure in newly developing systems. Studying the relationship between signs and gestures provides a new window onto the human ability to recruit multiple levels of representation (e.g., categorical, gradient, iconic, abstract) in the service of using or creating conventionalized communicative systems.","Gestures|Humans|Language|Language Development|Pattern Recognition, Visual|Sign Language"

22465114",Sexual and reproductive health: progress and outstanding needs.,2015-01-03,"We examine progress towards the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) commitment to provide universal access to sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services by 2014, with an emphasis on changes for those living in poor and emerging economies. Accomplishments include a 45% decline in the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) between 1990 and 2013; 11.5% decline in global unmet need for modern contraception; ~21% increase in skilled birth attendance; and declines in both the case fatality rate and rate of abortion. Yet aggregate gains mask stark inequalities, with low coverage of services for the poorest women. Demographic and Health Surveys and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys from 80 developing countries highlight persistent disparities in skilled birth attendance by household wealth: in 70 of 80 countries (88%), ≥80% of women in the highest quintile were attended by a skilled provider at last birth; in only 23 of the same countries (29%) was this the case for women in the lowest wealth quintile. While there have been notable declines in HIV incidence and prevalence, women affected by HIV are too often bereft of other SRH services, including family planning. Achieving universal access to SRH will require substantially greater investment in comprehensive and integrated services that reach the poor.",Female|Health Services Needs and Demand|Humans|Internationality|Maternal Health|Reproductive Health|Sexual Behavior

24682960",Advancing a biopsychosocial and contextual model of sleep in adolescence: a review and introduction to the special issue.,2015-01-02,"Sleep problems in adolescence have been identified as an international public health issue. Over the past few decades, notable advances have been made in our understanding of the patterns and consequences of sleep in adolescence. Despite these important gains, there is much about the role of sleep in adolescence that remains to be understood. This Special Issue brings together studies that examine sleep as it specifically pertains to adolescent development and adjustment. In this introductory article, we argue for the importance of grounding the study of sleep and adolescence in developmental science and a developmental psychopathology framework. First, a review of the literature is used to outline a biopsychosocial and contextual model of sleep in adolescence. Second, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is used as an exemplar of the proposed model given the pervasiveness of sleep problems among youth with ADHD and the likelihood that sleep problems and ADHD symptoms are interconnected in complex ways. Finally, a brief introduction to the empirical articles included in the Special Issue is provided, with particular attention given to how these articles fit within the proposed biopsychosocial and contextual model. Along with the framework proposed in this article, the studies included in this Special Issue advance the current literature and point to critical directions for future research.","Adolescent|Adolescent Development|Anxiety|Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity|Depression|Humans|Models, Biological|Psychology|Risk Factors|Sleep|Sleep Wake Disorders"

From dyadic work with a two-year-old's tantrums, to play therapy using deep-sea symbolism with a five-year-old; from the interchange with parents and school administrators in a middle school regarding ""sexting, "" to the in-depth assessment of children upon entry to a special school, these papers illustrate enriching exchanges between psychoanalysts, educators, children, and their communities.","Adolescent|Adolescent Psychiatry|Child|Child Psychiatry|Child, Preschool|Humans|Psychoanalysis|Psychopharmacology|School Health Services|Schools"
27337809,The War against Women in Psychoanalytic Culture: Introduction to the Section.,2015-01-01,"The phrase ""the war against women"" refers to the overt an a stealth global prejudice against women that aims to subjugate them. Freud was not immune to this prejudice, as can be seen in those late-nineteenth-century Victorian views about sexuality that helped to shape his conceptualizations of gender. Despite the fact that many of these antediluvian views have been overturned, some continue to live on in the contemporary psychoanalytic scene. This introduction provides an overview of the contributions in this section, which explore how the war quietly or openly insinuates its way into our psychoanalytic culture. The offerings will undoubtedly appeal to the readership, whether one's interest concerning the war leans toward considering a contemporary recontextualization of foundational tenets within the psychoanalytic setting, which directly affect women; how it appears within the domain of the consulting room; third-wave feminism's reach into theory and practice; or forms of institutional and organizational prejudice on the local and national levels, including the field of child analysis.",Hostility|Humans|Psychoanalysis|Sexism|Women

The premise of the volume is that social constructions of masculinity function simultaneously as foils for femininity and as methods of differentiating between ""kinds"" of men. In exploring scientific masculinities without taking the dominance of men and masculinity in the sciences for granted, we ask, What is masculinity and how does it operate in science? Our answers remind us that gender is at once an analytical category and a historical object. The essays are divided into three sections that in turn emphasize the importance of gender to the professionalization of scientific, technological, and medical practices, the spaces in which such labor is performed, and the ways that sex, gender, and sexual orientation are measured and serve as metaphors in society and culture.","History of Medicine|History, 15th Century|History, 16th Century|History, 17th Century|History, 18th Century|History, 19th Century|History, 20th Century|History, 21st Century|History, Medieval|Humans|Male|Masculinity|Men|Science|Technology"

At present, we know rather little about the naturalistic development of mindfulness or compassion in children and adolescents, or the processes by which parents can socialize these positive qualities in their offspring. Thus, the goal of this special section is to showcase empirical research articles that redress this absence of a developmental focus in contemplative science by focusing on issues of construct conceptualization and measurement, socialization practices in families, and the role that interventions can play in fostering mindfulness and compassion in children, adolescents, and care-givers alike.",Adolescent|Child|Concept Formation|Empathy|Human Development|Humans|Mindfulness|Self Concept|Socialization

25528975,Twenty years after International Conference on Population and Development: where are we with adolescent sexual and reproductive health and rights?,2014-12-23,"The International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo in 1994 laid out a bold, clear, and comprehensive definition of reproductive health and called for nations to meet the educational and service needs of adolescents to enable them to deal in a positive and responsible way with their sexuality. In the context of the ongoing review of the International Conference on Population and Development Programme of Action and the considerations for a post-2015 development agenda, this article summarizes the findings of the articles presented in this volume and identifies key challenges and critical answers that need to be tackled in addressing adolescent sexual and reproductive health and rights. The key recommendations are to link the provision of sexuality education and sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services; build awareness, acceptance, and support for youth-friendly SRH education and services; address gender inequality in terms of beliefs, attitudes, and norms; and target the early adolescent period (10-14 years). The many knowledge gaps, however, point to the pressing need for further research on how to best design effective adolescent SRH intervention packages and how best to deliver them.","Abortion, Induced|Adolescent|Adolescent Health Services|Circumcision, Female|Female|Global Health|HIV Infections|Humans|Male|Maternal Mortality|Pregnancy|Pregnancy in Adolescence|Reproductive Health|Reproductive Rights|Sex Education|Sex Offenses|Young Adult"

21029734",Evolution of DOHaD: the impact of environmental health sciences.,2014-12-05,"Environmental exposures have a significant influence on the chronic health conditions plaguing children and adults. Although the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) paradigm historically has focused on nutrition, an expanding body of research specifically communicates the effects of chemical exposures on early-life development and the propagation of non-communicable disease across the lifespan. This paper provides an overview of 20 years of research efforts aimed at identifying critical windows of susceptibility to environmental exposures and the signaling changes and epigenetic influences associated with disease progression. DOHaD grants funded by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) in 1991, 2001 and 2011 are identified by grant-analysis software, and each portfolio is analyzed for exposures, disease endpoints, windows of exposure, study design and impact on the field based on publication data. Results show that the 1991 and 2001 portfolios comprised metals, PCBs and air pollutants; however, by 2011, the portfolio has evolved to include or expand the variety of endocrine disruptors, pesticides/persistent organic pollutants and metals. An assortment of brain-health endpoints is most targeted across the portfolios, whereas reproduction and cancer increase steadily over the same time period, and new endpoints like obesity are introduced by 2011. With mounting evidence connecting early-life exposures to later-life disease, we conclude that it is critical to expand the original DOHaD concept to include environmental chemical exposures, and to continue a research agenda that emphasizes defining sensitive windows of exposure and the mechanisms that cause disease.","Animals|Epigenesis, Genetic|Humans|Premature Birth"

This special supplement presents the proceedings of a symposium focusing on advances in scientific understanding of the development of healthy food portion sizes in children and their families. Recent basic research highlights individual differences in children's responsiveness to portion size as well as potential mechanisms of portion size effects. Quantitative approaches highlight the influence of maternal serving in determining intake, while qualitative approaches seek to elaborate caregiver decisions around child portion sizes at meals and snacks. Family-based environmental interventions for child weight control involving food portion size are outlined. An overview of the overarching issues and roundtable discussion on the forefronts of portion size research are presented as well as policy considerations to promote healthy portion control.",Congresses as Topic|Humans|Pediatric Obesity|Portion Size

These effects of H2S were extensively studied, and some of the corresponding mechanisms were also studied in detail. Previous studies on the synergistic interaction between H2S and nitric oxide (NO) have led to the discovery of several potential signaling molecules. Polysulfides are considerably potent and are one of the most active forms of H2S. H2S has a significant therapeutic potential, which is evident from the large number of novel H2S-donating compounds and substances developed for manipulating endogenous levels of H2S. The Third International Conference on H2S was held in Kyoto in June 2014. One hundred and sixty participants from 21 countries convened in Kyoto to report new advances, discuss conflicting findings, and make plans for future research. This article summarizes each oral presentation presented at the conference.",Animals|Biochemistry|Cell Physiological Phenomena|Humans|Hydrogen Sulfide|Inflammation|Japan|Mice|Nitric Oxide|Signal Transduction

Childhood cerebral ALD (CCALD) is the most frequent phenotype.
We describe an affected boy who developed normally until he was 8 years old then suffered progressive neurological deficits that ultimately led to death.
Diagnosis was based on clinical symptoms, an abnormal very long chain fatty acid profile in plasma, typical CCALD MRI pattern, and molecular analysis.
Direct sequencing of the ABCD1 gene in this patient identified a novel splicing mutation (IVS1+1G>A) in intron 1, which is considered to be the pathogenic mutation.
We have identified a novel ABCD1 mutation as the likely cause of CCALD in a Chinese patient.","ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily D, Member 1|ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters|Adrenoleukodystrophy|Amino Acid Sequence|Animals|Child|China|Genetic Diseases, X-Linked|Humans|Male|Molecular Sequence Data|Mutation|Sequence Homology, Amino Acid"

22972298","Viruses and disease: emerging concepts for prevention, diagnosis and treatment.",2014-11-05,"Viruses cause a wide range of human diseases, ranging from acute self-resolving conditions to acute fatal diseases. Effects that arise long after the primary infection can also increase the propensity for chronic conditions or lead to the development of cancer. Recent advances in the fields of virology and pathology have been fundamental in improving our understanding of viral pathogenesis, in providing improved vaccination strategies and in developing newer, more effective treatments for patients worldwide. The reviews assembled here focus on the interface between virology and pathology and encompass aspects of both the clinical pathology of viral disease and the underlying disease mechanisms. Articles on emerging diseases caused by Ebola virus, Marburg virus, coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS, Nipah virus and noroviruses are followed by reviews of enteroviruses, HIV infection, measles, mumps, human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza, cytomegalovirus (CMV) and varicella zoster virus (VZV). The issue concludes with a series of articles reviewing the relationship between viruses and cancer, including the role played by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in the pathogenesis of lymphoma and carcinoma; how human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are involved in the development of skin cancer; the involvement of hepatitis B virus infection in hepatocellular carcinoma; and the mechanisms by which Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) leads to Kaposi's sarcoma. We hope that this collection of articles will be of interest to a wide range of scientists and clinicians at a time when there is a renaissance in the appreciation of the power of pathology as virologists dissect the processes of disease.","Animals|Cooperative Behavior|Host-Pathogen Interactions|Humans|Interdisciplinary Communication|Pathology, Molecular|Predictive Value of Tests|Prognosis|Risk Factors|Virology|Virulence|Virus Diseases|Viruses"

25426116",Dying autologous cells as instructors of the immune system.,2014-10-31,"In an organism, cell death occurs at many different sites and in many different forms. It is frequently part of normal development or serves to maintain cell homeostasis. In other cases, cell death not only occurs due to injury, disease or infection, but also as a consequence of various therapeutic interventions. However, in all of these scenarios, the immune system has to react to the dying and dead cells and decide whether to mount an immune response, to remain quiet or to initiate healing and repopulation. This is essential for the organism, testified by many diseases that are associated with malfunctioning in the cell death process, the corpse removal, or the ensuing immune responsiveness. Therefore, dying cells generally have to be considered as instructors of the immune system. How this happens and which signals and pathways contribute to modulate or shape the immune response is still elusive in many conditions. The articles presented in this Special Issue address such open questions. They highlight that the context in which cell death occurs will not only influence the cell death process itself, but also affect the surrounding cellular milieu, how the generation and presence of 'eat me' signals can have an impact on cell clearance, and that the exact nature of the residual 'debris' and how it is processed are fundamental to determining the immunological consequences. Hopefully, these articles initiate new approaches and new experiments to complete our understanding of how cell death and the immune system interact with each other.",Cell Death|Humans|Immune System

Toxicologic pathologists work in diverse settings studying changes elicited by pharmacological, chemical, and environmental agents and factors that modify these responses. Regardless of the work setting, society members are dedicated to the integration of toxicologic pathology into hazard identification, risk assessment, and risk communication regarding human and animal exposure to potentially toxic substances. Toxicologic pathologists routinely face not only questions regarding pathological changes related to compound exposure but also questions concerning what translational relevance those lesions and exposures have to a human population or organ system. This symposium provided a basis for the membership to understand the variety of roles the toxicologic pathologist plays in translational science, where our gaps in translational science are, and how we can move forward to better address the challenges in the field translational science in order to continue to positively impact human health.","Animals|Humans|Pathology|Toxicology|Translational Research, Biomedical"
25341852,New technological and clinical trends in blood pressure theranostics: is it time to consider a spatio-temporal approach?,2014-10-25,"Blood pressure (BP) is traditionally assessed, for centuries, at the brachial artery by cuff-based sphygmomanometric techniques. Technological and methodological innovations as well as emerging new findings from clinical studies and trials now provoke a re-consideration of traditional strategies for BP management. The existing knowledge regarding the occurring changes of BP over time (temporal variability) and the evident differences of BP levels between central and peripheral arteries (spatial variability) now pilots the progress in current therapeutic and diagnostic (""theranostic"") concepts and practices in hypertension. This special issue of Current Pharmaceutical Design covers current and intriguing topics regarding the technological, physiological, diagnostic, therapeutic and prognostic aspects of ""spatio-temporal"" assessment of BP variations.

How can the processes of translating our science be improved and innovated?
We analyze articles published in American Journal of Human Biology from 2004-2013, and find there is very little human biological consideration of issues related to most of the core human challenges such as water, energy, environmental degradation, or conflict. There is some focus on disease, and considerable focus on food/nutrition. We then introduce this special volume with reference to the following articles that provide exemplars for the process of how translation and concern for broader context and impacts can be integrated into research.
Human biology has significant unmet potential to engage more fully in translation for the public good, through consideration of the topics we focus on, the processes of doing our science, and the way we present our domain expertise.",Anthropology|Humans|Information Dissemination|Research Design
25331123,Introduction to membrane lipids.,2014-10-22,"Biological membranes are composed largely of lipids and proteins. The most common arrangement of lipids in biological membranes is as a bilayer. This arrangement spontaneously forms a barrier for the passage of polar materials. The bilayer is thin but can have a large area in the dimension perpendicular to its thickness. The physical nature of the bilayer membrane will vary according to the conditions of the environment as well as the chemical structure of the lipid constituents of the bilayer. These physical properties determine the function of the membrane together with specific structural features of the lipids that allow them to have signaling properties. The lipids of the membrane are not uniformly distributed. There is an intrinsic asymmetry between the two monolayers that constitute the bilayer. In addition, some lipids tend to be enriched in particular regions of the membrane, termed domains. There is evidence that certain domains recruit specific proteins into that domain. This has been suggested to be important for allowing interaction among different proteins involved in certain signal transduction pathways. Membrane lipids have important roles in determining the physical properties of the membrane, in modulating the activity of membrane-bound proteins and in certain cases being specific secondary messengers that can interact with specific proteins. A large variety of lipids present in biological membranes result in them possessing many functions.",Animals|Cell Membrane|Cholesterol|Glycerophospholipids|Mammals|Membrane Lipids|Sphingomyelins

In this introduction to the special issue, we review five advances and areas of agreement that are highlighted across the articles, including the utility of trait perspectives to psychopathy, the emergence of a prototypical trait profile of psychopathy, the importance of recognizing earlier developmental manifestations of psychopathy, the ongoing study and revelation of the basic neural underpinnings of psychopathy, and the important theoretical and empirical association between psychopathy and antisocial behavior. At the same time, several important debates remain, which are also highlighted in the special issue's articles. These debates center around the necessity and sufficiency of certain psychopathy traits, the role of traits alternatively labeled stable Extraversion, fearless dominance, or boldness, and the validity and utility of separating psychopathy from Machiavellianism as is done in research on the Dark Triad.",Antisocial Personality Disorder|Humans|Personality

25319774,"Microbiological diagnosis of sepsis: the confounding effects of a ""gold standard"".",2014-10-17,"The need of rapid and sensitive diagnostic techniques for sepsis is every day more compelling. Its morbidity and mortality loads are dramatically high, with one quarter of patients eventually dying. Several diagnostic progresses have been made in the last years using both molecular- and nonmolecular-based approaches, and they have to be broadly shared in the scientific community also under the technical point of view. The initial chapters of this book give a thorough overlook of the state of the art in the actual diagnosis of sepsis. The other chapters provide a broad range of protocols describing both already used and futuristic tools, covering both microbiological and nonmicrobiological aspects. The potential role of each described protocol is evidenced by a brief introduction on the specific topic of each chapter. A final chapter describing algorithms potentially useful in stratifying the risk of sepsis in each single patient and suggesting the future perspectives in the diagnosis of sepsis closes the book.",Bacterial Typing Techniques|Biomarkers|Humans|Mass Spectrometry|Polymerase Chain Reaction|Sepsis|Survival Analysis

The IMA Health 2013 conference brought together health care managers, clinicians, management consultants, and mathematicians, operational and health service researchers, statisticians and health economists from across the world with a view to bridging the gap between the respective communities, to exploring recent developments and identifying opportunities for further research. The eight selected papers of this special issue have been grouped into two broad categories. First, there are five papers that report on studies conducted in or relevant to care provision within hospitals. The three remaining papers concern studies aimed at problems related to care provided outside the hospital including long-term care, community based care services and public health. A key learning point arising from these papers and the discussions that took place during the conference is that the systems modelling community need not only to focus their efforts in developing new and improving the performance of existing algorithms, but also in achieving better integration with qualitative research methods and with various relevant strands of the social sciences (ethnography, organisation behaviour etc.). In any case, collaborative projects which engage directly with those involved both in delivering and receiving health care is key if modelling is to make a difference in tackling the messy and complex problems of health and social care.","Delivery of Health Care|Health Services Research|Humans|Models, Organizational"

Thus, to fully illuminate risk for involvement in bullying, we must investigate contextual features of schools that heighten or minimize aggression among students and the targeting of children for peer victimization. To this end, the articles in this special section each contribute conceptually and empirically to the study of school-related factors in bullying and peer victimization. This introduction summarizes and highlights the major findings of each paper, organized around two major themes of the articles-the role of peer group ecologies and the role of the classroom teacher.

H2S is physiologically important because it protects various organs from ischemia-reperfusion injury besides regulating inflammation, oxygen sensing, cell growth, and senescence. The production, metabolism, and regulation of H2S have been studied extensively. H2S modulates target proteins through sulfhydration (or sulfuration) or by the reduction of cysteine disulfide bonds. A large number of novel H2S-donating compounds are being developed owing to the therapeutic potential of H2S. Recently, polysulfides, rather than H2S, have been identified as molecules that sulfhydrate (or sulfurate) their target proteins.",Animals|Gasotransmitters|Humans|Hydrogen Sulfide|Inflammation|Reperfusion Injury|Signal Transduction|Sulfides
